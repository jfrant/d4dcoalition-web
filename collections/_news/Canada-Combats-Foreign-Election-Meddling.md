Canada spent three years [developing][l1] a detailed plan to combat foreign interference ahead of its election in October. After Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election became evident, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s government passed a law mandating transparency surrounding political ads on social media platforms. Canada also created a [Critical Election Incident Public Protocol][l2] to notify political parties and the general public if credible threats of foreign interference are detected, however [the system was not used][l3] during the election and no major foreign influence was detected, according to the Canadian government. Some were skeptical that the tactics can successfully prevent cyberattacks or the spread of disinformation, while others criticized Trudeau for focusing too specifically on Russian meddling, when his campaign was supported by Canadian progressive groups that received funding from the United States.
