The MIT Technology Review published an [article][l1] describing the shift in the use of memes as an innocent form of social commentary to their utilization by politically aligned groups and individuals to influence social media users and spread misinformation. Meme campaigns are often used to spread propaganda and disinformation to both boost and diminish support for political parties, candidates, and governments. The article explores various “meme wars,” including the campaign used during Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.
