The Elections Observation Group is a collection of election monitoring groups in Kenya, working collaboratively to promote free and fair elections, part of which involves countering disinformation. In a recent article, ELOG wrote about the impact of WhatsApp on the spread of disinformation: “the messaging app has also come under fire for its role in spreading political propaganda and misinformation. In an effort to curb this, WhatsApp earlier had introduced a Forward icon on to every forwarded message to caution recipient and recently, it has set limits for forwarding messages. Also, with expanded features such as Forwarding Info and Frequently Forwarded, the platform hopes to help users in determining whether a message they received is widely circulated, and if it is, then chances are it might contain fake information. WhatsApp, policymakers and civil society groups should engage and focus on reforms that would enhance the platform's capacity to promote participation and accountability while reducing the risk that it contributes to political manipulation and conflict.”
