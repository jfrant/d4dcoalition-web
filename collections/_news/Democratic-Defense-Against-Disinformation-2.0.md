The Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center builds upon its February 2018 initial publication to release the [Democratic Defense Against Disinformation 2.0][link] paper. This paper reviews developments to counter disinformation over the past year and provides recommendations for next steps.While it recognizes the efforts by democracies to shift from "admiring the problem" to efforts to testing new ideas and solutions, and building resilience against disinformation, it also acknowledges that disinformation is also evolving and advancing. Recommendations in this report include policies and actions to limit the influx of disinformation and investing in long-term social resilience against disinformation, including digital literacy education and raising social awareness. It also recommends the establishment of a U.S/E.U Counter-Disinformation Coalition to bring together government and non-government stakeholders and a voluntary code of conduct outlining principles and agreed procedures for dealing with disinformation.
