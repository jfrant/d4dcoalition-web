Federal prosecutors [charged][l1] two former Twitter employees with spying for Saudi Arabia. This marks the first time the Department of Justice has publicly acknowledged the presence of Saudi agents in the United States. The incident calls into question the ability of social media platforms to protect the private information of users from repressive governments. The individuals implicated are accused of accessing the accounts of over 6,000 known dissidents and critics on behalf of the Saudi government back in 2015. One former Twitter employee has been arrested and the other is believed to be in Saudi Arabia.
