With funding from the The National Democratic Institute (NDI), a founding member of the D4D Coalition, has hired a Community Manager, Kristi Arbogast, to help manage the growing Coalition, lead new member recruitment, and expand member engagement. Kristi previously worked at NDI, where she assisted with building out the D4D Coalition and helped manage the Open Internet for Democracy Initiative. Prior to NDI, Kristi worked at Open Gov Hub, a collaborative community of 40+ organizations working to put accountability, transparency, and participation at the heart of democracy. If you have any questions or ideas about the D4D Coalition, our community, or ways to get further involved, contact Kristi at karbogast@ndi.org.American and British governments, [over 50 schools in Ukraine are working disinformation awareness skills into their core curriculum][link]. Now in the fifth year of a civil war that has demolished much of the eastern part of the country, Ukraine has also been the victim of a calculated, intensive disinformation campaign by Russia, which backs separatist rebels fighting the Ukrainian government. The new “Learn to Discern” program aims to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren to spot stories, photos, videos and other media that are false narratives appropriated by Russian government sources.
