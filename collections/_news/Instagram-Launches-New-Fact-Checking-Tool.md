Instagram [launched][link1] a new fact-checking tool in September, part of Facebook’s attempt to tackle disinformation on its various platforms. The new flagging feature on Instagram allows users to report a post with three options: “report,” “it’s inappropriate,” or “false information.” Posts that are rated as false by fact-checkers will not appear on a hashtag search and explore pages. The Instagram user whose content is reported and rated will not be notified.
