Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey [announced][l1] that the company will be funding an independent team to explore the development of a [decentralized protocol standard][l2] for social media content moderation purposes. The team, called BlueSky, will experiment with a protocol approach that Twitter could potentially adopt. Platforms such as Twitter are struggling to adequately moderate propaganda and disinformation on their sites. According to a [report][l3] cited in the announcement, the switch to a standard protocol approach could enable more free speech while limiting hate speech and large-scale disinformation efforts throughout social media.
