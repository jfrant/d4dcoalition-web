Apple shareholders [will vote][l1] on a motion that could force the company to disclose policies related to human rights and report decisions that could impact freedom of expression. The motion comes after a campaign group called SumofUs filed a resolution calling for the company to be more transparent. The group points to Apple’s removal of a mapping app during the Hong Kong protests as evidence that the company is pandering to Beijing. They argue that by complying with Chinese orders, the company could harm innocent groups of people and ethnic minorities.
