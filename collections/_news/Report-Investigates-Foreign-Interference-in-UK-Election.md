Last year, the Atlantic Council uncovered Secondary Infektion, a disinformation campaign that originated in Russia involving the spread of falsified documents through dozens of social media platforms. Social media analytics firm Graphika published [findings][l1] from an investigation into the resemblance between a leak of UK trade documents and that of Secondary Infektion. [The report][l2] found that the recent leak of classified government trade documents, which occurred right before the UK election, closely mirrored the Russian disinformation campaign in a number of ways. Notably, the UK leak gained much more traction in the media. It is unclear whether the leaked documents have been altered and how they were obtained.
