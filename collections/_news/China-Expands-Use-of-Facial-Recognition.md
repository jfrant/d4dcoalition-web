Citizens in China are now required to have their [face and government ID][l1] scanned in order to verify their identity when purchasing a cell phone. China has been working to expand the use of facial recognition for years, supposedly to reduce fraud and strengthen cybersecurity. However, many citizens have voiced opposition to being so closely monitored by the government. Concerns with the technology also include the risk of data breaches, hacking, and misuse of biometric data by private entities. China has already come under fire for using surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition to target and track Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.
