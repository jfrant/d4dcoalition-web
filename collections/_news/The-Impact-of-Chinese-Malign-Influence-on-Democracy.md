D4D Coalition member IRI published a report on the impact of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) influence on democratic resilience. The [report][link1] consists of condensed versions of research findings from researchers in 12 vulnerable democracies around the world. It concludes that China’s aggressive influence campaign uses sophisticated methods to threaten democracy in developing nations. In order to combat malign influence, the report recommends that the United States and its democratic partners raise awareness of the CCP’s tactics and offer developing countries alternatives to Chinese investment and financing.
