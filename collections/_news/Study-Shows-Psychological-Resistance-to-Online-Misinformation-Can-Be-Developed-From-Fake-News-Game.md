Researchers [designed a game][link] that enables players to deploy six commonly used techniques used for misinformation so that they may take on the role of a producer of misinformation. The 15,000 players were then surveyed within the game to determine any change in a participantâ€™s ability to spot and resist misinformation. The findings show that individuals, regardless of education, age, political, ideology, and cognitive style, improved their ability to spot and resist misinformation after gameplay.
