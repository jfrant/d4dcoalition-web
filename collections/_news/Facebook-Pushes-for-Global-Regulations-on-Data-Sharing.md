Facebook [released][link1] a [white paper][link2] calling on regulators to introduce a global data sharing standard after facing backlash surrounding privacy and transparency concerns, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company is seeking a framework that will enhance existing privacy legislation, establish when user data can be transferred, determine how information should be protected, and designate who is responsible for the misuse of data. In addition to regulating privacy and election integrity, Facebook has an interest in securing a standard for data portability. Many Facebook users choose to transfer data between the platform and other apps or services, calling into question who should be responsible for protecting information once it has been moved.
