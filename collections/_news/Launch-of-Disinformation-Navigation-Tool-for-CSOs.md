The Oxford Internet Institute's Project on Computational Propaganda launched the [Comprop Navigator][l1], an online tool for civil society organizations to deal with problems related to disinformation. The organization hosted a series of workshops about disinformation with organizations working on issues such as human rights, racism, gender and LGBTQI+ justice. This guide features resources recommended by participants and selected material representing the broader contexts of where the workshops were held around the world.
