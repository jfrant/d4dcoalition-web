The 2019 Freedom on the Net [report][l1] assessed improvements and declines in internet freedom in 65 countries around the world. Internet freedom scores were impacted by malign influence operations, social media surveillance, abuse of civil liberties, and censorship. Additional infringements on internet freedom included disinformation campaigns, internet shutdowns, and violence against journalists. 33 of the assessed countries, including the United States, demonstrated an overall decline in internet freedom from June 2018 to May 2019. Iceland was ranked as the best protector of internet freedom, while China was ranked as the worst abuser of internet freedom.
