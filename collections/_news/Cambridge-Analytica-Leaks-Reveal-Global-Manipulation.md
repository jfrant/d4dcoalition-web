An anonymous Twitter account [leaked][l1] tens of thousands of documents related to the data firm Cambridge Analytica. Although the company is no longer operating, the documents give new insight into its operations to manipulate the electoral system and influence voters on a massive scale. The leaks were found to have originated from former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser, who has expressed concern that the infamous Facebook data scandal was part of a larger global operation involving collaboration between governments, intelligence agencies, commercial companies and political campaigns to manipulate voters. Thousands of more documents detailing the companyâ€™s work in 68 countries are scheduled to be released over the next few months.
