Amid Facebook’s recent efforts to tackle disinformation on its platforms, Facebook [announced][l1] that it would “treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.” Facebook also stated that [opinion pieces and satire][l2] determined by fact-checking programs to be false will not be labeled as such, and that political ads would not be checked. These announcements drew opposition from U.S. Congress, particularly during CEO Mark Zuckerburg’s [testimony on Capitol Hill.][l3] Zuckerberg also delivered a [speech][l4] at Georgetown University, in which he defended Facebook’s opposition to fact-checking political ads and emphasized the importance of protecting free speech. Facebook has moved to address its policies company-wide through the [formation of an independent oversight board.][l5]
