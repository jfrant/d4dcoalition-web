Snapchat has joined peers Facebook and Twitter in [releasing][l1] a publicly available [library of political ads.][l2] The ad archives feature includes information about who paid for each ad, the amount of money spent, and the targeted demographic(s). A spokesperson for the app stated that all political and issue-based Snapchat ads are reviewed prior to approval. The transparency of social media companies has been prioritized by U.S. lawmakers since Russian-linked ads and disinformation campaigns came to light during the 2016 elections. The platform remains popular with 2020 U.S. presidential candidates, who sell merchandise through ads and share photos and videos from the campaign trail. While the majority of the documented ads are from the U.S., the library also contains ads from Nigeria, Europe and Australia.
