In partnership with [Article 19][link1] and [Meedan][link2], NDI is examining how marginalized communities in Kenya are impacted in online spaces and how disinformation and hate speech spreads. Final results from this participatory research are expected in early 2020. Through this project, the Coalition has grown to include many great Kenyan organizations that joined D4D to lend their expertise. In the next Download, we will introduce you to all of our new Members.
