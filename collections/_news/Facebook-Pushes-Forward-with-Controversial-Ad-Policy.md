Facebook [continued its call][l1] for government regulation of social media advertising while doubling down on the platform’s refusal to limit or fact-check targeted political ads, even those containing misinformation. The platform’s policy is in stark contrast with those of Google and Twitter, which have taken measures to limit and ban political ads, respectively. Instead, Facebook announced that it will allow users to have slightly more control over the number of political ads they encounter and will improve user access to the company’s ad library. Politicians, activists, and even the company’s own employees have expressed criticism of Facebook’s policy for allowing paid “microtargeting” and questionable political advertising to undermine democracy.
