WhatsApp [took legal action][l1] against NSO Group, an Israeli cybersurveillance firm, for using the app in an espionage campaign that targeted journalists and human rights activists. The lawsuit alleges that the firm used WhatsApp to hack the phones of at least 1,400 targets in 20 countries, including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico. WhatsApp discovered the attack on users while working in conjunction with Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto in Canada. The research group investigated NSO Groupâ€™s role in creating technology that has been used in hacking attempts worldwide.
