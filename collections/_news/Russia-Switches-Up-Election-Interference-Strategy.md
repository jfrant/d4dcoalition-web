Prior to the September 8th Moscow City Council elections, a list that first appeared on a Russian site, VKontakte, was widely circulated on social media. Named after award-winning actor Vasily Lanovoy, [Lanovoy’s list][l1] appeared to name candidates who Lanovoy believed should be elected in every precinct, and was aligned with government-supported candidates. Despite the fact that Lanovoy refuted the list and denied that he had made it, it continued to be widely circulated online and in the media. The list appeared to have been circulated in response to the “Smart Vote” campaign led by prominent opposition leader Alexey Navalny and liberal activists, which pushed candidates in Moscow that were not favored by the current administration. Lanovoy’s list represents a new type of online disinformation campaign to influence elections and promote the Russian government’s interests.
