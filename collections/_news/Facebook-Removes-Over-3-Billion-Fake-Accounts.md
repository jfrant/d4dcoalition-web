Facebook [reported][l1] the removal of over 3 billion fake accounts over the span of six months, as well as millions of posts featuring hate speech, drug sales, self-harm or affiliation with terrorist groups. Last year, Facebook removed 1.55 billion accounts within the same span of time, indicating a rise in the number of fake accounts and the amount of misinformation on the platform. The company also disclosed the number of posts removed from Instagram and reported a slightly lower rate of proactively detecting violating content on the photo-sharing platform.
