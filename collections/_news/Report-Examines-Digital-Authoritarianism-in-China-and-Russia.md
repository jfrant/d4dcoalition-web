A report from [The Brookings Institution][link1] highlights Russian and Chinese use of digital information technology to support authoritarian rule domestically and abroad. The [policy brief][link2] compares high-tech Chinese censorship and surveillance to Russian intimidation tactics and its repressive legal system. The Chinese model is enticing for regimes interested in developing a surveillance network, while the Russian disinformation model serves as a lower-cost option for countries seeking to repress opposition and undermine democracy. The report concludes with a number of recommendations to prevent the export of technologies that advance digital authoritarianism, including the creation of a competitive democratic model of digital governance.
