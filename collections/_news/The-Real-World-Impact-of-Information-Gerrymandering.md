A new [report][link1] in Nature describes the phenomenon of [“information gerrymandering,”][link2] or how the structure of a social media network and the presence of zealots can bias a collective decision making towards one party, candidate, vote or issue. Similar to electoral gerrymandering, this outcome can occur even when both parties have equal sizes and each player has the same influence. The analysis uses a voter game model to examine restricted information flows and the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic distortion. The report also identifies examples of information gerrymandering in real-world networks, such as online discussions leading up to the U.S. elections, that could result in undemocratic decisions. It is noted that information gerrymandering can enable one party to sway outcomes in its favor, but can result in deadlock when there are multiple participants.
