The growing popularity of TikTok, a short-video app based in Beijing, [has sparked concerns][l1] over the link between Chinese tech giants and the countryâ€™s strict censorship laws. TikTok belongs to parent company ByteDance, which claims that their censorship policies do not affect the U.S. operation. However, employees in the United States have complained that the company imposes strict rules on what can and cannot appear on the app. In many instances, employees were instructed to follow the rules of headquarters in Beijing and censor videos that were deemed acceptable elsewhere.
