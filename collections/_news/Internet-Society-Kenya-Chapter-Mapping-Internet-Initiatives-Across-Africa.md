In partnership with [Safe House Africa][l1], [ISOC Kenya][l2] is working on mapping Internet of Things, digital identity, and online safety projects across Africa, to determine what work is collectively being done and where there are policy gaps to work on. This multistakeholder collaboration also aims to build awareness, learning, and skills training between those working on related projects.
