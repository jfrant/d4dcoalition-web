As part of an online espionage campaign, Chinese hackers have [infiltrated][l1] telecoms networks to track ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim minority group that the government considers to be a security threat. China has been facing international criticism for its mass detentions and state surveillance of Uighurs in Xinjiang Province. Many Uighurs flee Xinjiang and travel towards Europe to escape state persecution. According to a report by Reuters, telecoms operations in countries along the transit routes, such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand and Malaysia, have been compromised by groups likely aligned with the Chinese government. China has denied mistreatment of the Uighurs and any involvement in the cyberattacks, although the country has expressed concern that some travelers may be headed to join militant groups in Iraq and Syria.
