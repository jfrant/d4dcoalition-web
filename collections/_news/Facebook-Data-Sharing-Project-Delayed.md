During testimony to U.S. Congress in April 2018, Mark Zuckerburg outlined a plan to share a large amount of user data with researchers for the purpose of identifying and studying disinformation on Facebook. But [as the 2020 U.S. presidential elections near][link1], the company has yet to release any significant amount of data through the project. The platform claims that the delays are due to the challenge of protecting the privacy of users. Researchers have suggested that since 2016, disinformation campaigns have doubled and that Facebook remains the main platform for those campaigns.
