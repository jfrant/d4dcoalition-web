Former Google executive Ross LaJeunesse claims that the company [ousted][l1] him after he urged it to adopt a more formal program integrating human rights principles into its product development. LaJeunesse [started advocating][l2] for a public commitment to respecting the rights to free expression and privacy after it seemed like Google might renege on an earlier decision not to cooperate with Chinese censorship demands. His suspicions were confirmed after reports about Project Dragonfly, the company’s plans to launch a censored search app in China, were leaked. After continuing to express concern over the company’s potential dealings with China and Saudi Arabia, LaJeunesse was informed that his position was eliminated, and he declined the offer of an alternative position with the company.
