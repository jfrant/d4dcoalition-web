A Wall Street Journal investigative report illustrated how [Huawei[[l1], one of the largest tech companies in the world, has helped a host of African countries conduct digital surveillance of government political opponents. Huawei technicians in Uganda and Zambia assisted officials with intercepting encrypted messages and hacking social media accounts, as well as tracking the locations of individuals. The company also provided training to police and other security forces on how to carry out domestic cyber-surveillance on political opposition. A spokesperson from Huawei denied that the company engaged in hacking activities or any other wrongdoing. However, evidence shows multiple examples of Huawei employees playing an important role in accessing the private communications of those accused of using “antigovernment rhetoric,” particularly in Uganda.
