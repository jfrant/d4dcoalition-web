In an attempt to slow the spread of disinformation on the private, encrypted messaging application, [WhatsApp limited][link1] how often messages can be forwarded. Messages can now only be forwarded to a maximum of 5 groups, down from 20, which had already been reduced from 256. [Research][link2] by scholars from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. shows that the app has been successful in slowing down messages containing disinformation from reaching a wider network with such sharing limits. This is significant, as WhatsApp was influential in the spread of disinformation leading up to elections in Brazil and India. The study suggests that the company should continue to take further action to limit viral chain messages.
