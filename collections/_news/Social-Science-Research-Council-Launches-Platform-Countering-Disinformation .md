The New York-based international NGO, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) [launched][link1] MediaWell, a [platform][link2] that aggregates the latest research on disinformation, online politics, election interference, and other collisions between media and democracy. The public platform also summarizes research findings and identifies gaps in scholarship, and would be useful for both practitioners, researchers, journalists and others who are looking for resources to work on these issues.
