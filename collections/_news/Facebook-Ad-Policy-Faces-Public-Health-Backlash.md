Facebook is [facing harsh criticism][l1] from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and health professionals for running ads containing misinformation about HIV prevention medication. The social media platform is accused of contributing to a public health crisis by allowing claims of risks associated with the preventative drugs to intimidate patients at risk of contracting HIV. While the medications have been deemed safe by health officials and federal regulators, the ads were purchased by personal injury lawyers who point to data showing that the drugs can cause serious side effects when taken as a treatment for HIV. A spokesperson for Facebook claimed that the ads do not violate the company’s policies. As of now, the ads have not been assessed by any of Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers.
