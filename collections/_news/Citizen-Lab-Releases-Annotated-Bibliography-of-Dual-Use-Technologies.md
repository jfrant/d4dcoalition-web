Many dual-use technologies are tools and applications that were created to ensure security, perform investigations for law enforcement or provide data for intelligence services, but can be misused in the hands of others. Misuse of these technologies can undermine human rights by intercepting communications and blocking political content. To better understand the various functions of these technologies, [Citizen Lab researchers][link1] released an [annotated bibliography][link2] covering these issues.
