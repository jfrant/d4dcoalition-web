The Electronic Frontier Foundation [released a report][l1] on corporate surveillance technology and the actions consumers and policymakers must take to retaliate against invasive practices. The report focuses on the third-party tracking techniques that companies use to collect, share, and sell the personal information of consumers. It recommends that consumers block tracking on their devices and that policymakers introduce comprehensive privacy laws to limit third-party tracking.
