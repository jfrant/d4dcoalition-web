The Federal Trade Commission [may seek][l1] a preliminary injunction against Facebook due to antitrust concerns over the company’s interoperability policies, or how the company integrates its products and allows them to work with potential competitors. The action would likely seek to block Facebook from enforcing policies that limit the ability of other products to compete. Facebook’s efforts to further integrate its own apps could also make it more difficult to split up the company in an antitrust case. The FTC’s decision to move forward with an antitrust action or seek an injunction over Facebook’s interoperability policies could come as early as next month.
