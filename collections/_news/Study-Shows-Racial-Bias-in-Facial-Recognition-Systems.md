The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [released a report][l1] assessing the accuracy of facial recognition software on different demographics. NIST evaluated 189 software algorithms and [concluded][l2] that the performance of facial recognition algorithms were dependent on demographic factors such as age, sex and race. While some algorithms were more accurate than others, the study found that Asian and African American men were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men and that women were more likely to be misidentified than men. The confirmation of biases in the algorithms raises serious concerns about their use by law enforcement.
