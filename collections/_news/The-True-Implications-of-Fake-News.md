Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review [conducted research][l1] on the implications of fake news on public participation in politics and perceptions of the media or political parties. The report collected data by examining consumption of fake news from untrustworthy websites and randomized exposure to misinformation. The study concluded that while both random exposure and intentional consumption of fake news increased the misperceptions of participants, the impacts on their political attitudes were inconsistent. The results question the validity of common claims regarding the effects of fake news.
