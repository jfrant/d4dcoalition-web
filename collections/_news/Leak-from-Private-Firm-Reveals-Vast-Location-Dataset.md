The latest piece in The New York Times “Privacy Project” features an enormous data file containing billions of cell phone pings harvested from millions of Americans all over the country. The file was [leaked][l1] by an anonymous source in hopes of raising public awareness of the existence of the data and the risks of the data being abused. The data originated from a location data company, which is part of a larger location tracking industry that remains largely unregulated and unscrutinized. Although the practice is legal and companies claim the data they collect is anonymous, The Times was able to use the dataset to track and identify individuals across the country. This demonstrates that precise geolocation information is almost impossible to anonymize. When combined with other sources of identifying information and considering the risk of data breaches, the magnitude of location information available should raise serious privacy concerns.
