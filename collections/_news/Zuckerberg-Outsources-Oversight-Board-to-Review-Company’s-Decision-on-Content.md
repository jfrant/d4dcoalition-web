[Facebook][link1] revealed a charter for a 40-person [Oversight Board][link2] that will oversee which content can appear on Facebook-owned platforms and which rules apply when posts need to be taken down. The board will work independently of Facebook, and members will serve three-year terms. Additionally, Facebook will implement the board’s content decisions and the board may issue policy recommendations to Facebook. The system for users to initiate appeals to the board will be made available in 2020.
