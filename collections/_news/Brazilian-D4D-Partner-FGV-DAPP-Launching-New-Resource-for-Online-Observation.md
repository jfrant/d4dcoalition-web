The Digital Democracy Room (DDR) is a Brazilian initiative by [FGV DAPP][l1] – an applied research center based in Rio de Janeiro – which aims to analyze the impact of the internet and social media on the political-electoral process. The project’s goal is to monitor and analyze the transformations of the ecosystem of information in democracies and the use and dissemination of disinformation strategies. Initially focused on the 2018 elections in Brazil, the project enters a new phase marked by the establishment of key partnerships with institutions from other Latin American countries in order to expand its main goal of strengthening the democratic institutions in the region. These partners are Chequeado, in Argentina; Linterna Verde, in Colombia; and Ojo Público, in Peru. The project’s new [website][l2], launching on January 20th, will contain analysis formulated by all partners in Portuguese, Spanish, and English.
