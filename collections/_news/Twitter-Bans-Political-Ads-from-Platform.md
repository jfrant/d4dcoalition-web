Twitter [announced][l1] that the social media platform would ban political advertising entirely, starting on November 22. The ban includes ads pertaining to specific candidates and issues, but spares ads encouraging people to vote. The move comes after Facebook was scrutinized for allowing political ads to contain false information. CEO Jack Dorsey explained the decision in a [series of tweets][l2], writing, “This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.”
