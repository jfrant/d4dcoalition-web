NATO StratCom [published a report][l1] examining the online environment in the Philippines to identify the different available work arrangements within the digital political trolling industry. The report compares and contrasts the state-sponsored model, the in-house staff model, the advertising and PR model, and the clickbait model. According to the report, disinformation in the Philippines is produced through collaboration and competition among government actors, influencer agencies, PR firms, and political consultants.
