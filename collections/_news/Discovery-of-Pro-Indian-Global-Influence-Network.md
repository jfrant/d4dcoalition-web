[An investigation][l1] by the EU Disinformation Task Force uncovered an extensive pro-Indian influence network targeting European decision-making in Brussels and Geneva and similar operations in more than 65 countries. The investigation connected over 265 fraudulent websites and think tanks to Indian stakeholders through the Srivastava Group. Many of the sites used the names of extinct newspapers to repost syndicated content and publish additional stories sympathetic to India’s lobbying efforts and criticizing Pakistan’s role in the Kashmir conflict. The fake media outlets had ties to NGOs and think tanks that amplified their content through social media.
