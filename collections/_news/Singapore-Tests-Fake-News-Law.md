For the first time, Singapore [exercised][l1] authority gained through the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation (POFMA) Act. The Singapore government issued a correction detention to the author of a Facebook post it claimed was false and legally required the social media platform to include a disclaimer on the post that read, “Facebook is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information.” The man accused of posting the falsehood does not live in Singapore and did not comply with the order. Although the disclaimer was only visible to Facebook users in Singapore, the instance raises concerns about the law’s impact on freedom of expression in the country.
