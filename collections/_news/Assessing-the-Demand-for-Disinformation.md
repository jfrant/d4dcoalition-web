The National Endowment for Democracy [released a working paper][l1] that examines the psychology of news consumption and opinion formation in order to assess the demand for disinformation. The research aims to understand the factors that contribute to passive or active decisions to seek out disinformation in order to develop effective responses to the disinformation landscape. The report calls for improved communication between fact-checkers and difficult-to-persuade audiences, the enhancement of media literacy, and increased consideration of the impact of emerging technologies on disinformation.
