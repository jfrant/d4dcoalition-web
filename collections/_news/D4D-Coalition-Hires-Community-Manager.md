To help manage the growing D4D Coalition, founding member the National Democratic Institute (NDI) has hired a Community Manager, Kristi Arbogast, to lead new member recruitment and member engagement. Kristi previously worked at NDI, where she assisted with building out the D4D Coalition and helped manage the Open Internet for Democracy Initiative. Prior to NDI, Kristi worked at Open Gov Hub, a collaborative community of 40+ organizations working to put accountability, transparency, and participation at the heart of democracy. If you have any questions or ideas about the D4D Coalition, our community, or ways to get further involved, contact Kristi at karbogast@ndi.org.
