The Alliance for Securing Democracy initiative at the German Marshall Fund of the United States has revamped its [Hamilton 2.0 dashboard][link1], which provides a summary analysis of the narratives and topics promoted by the Russian government and Russian state-funded media. It features content from more than 140 diplomatic and media accounts on Twitter, four state-sponsored news websites, RT News television broadcasts, and RT America and RT UKâ€™s YouTube channels. Updates include improved search functions, and the site will eventually expand to include the messaging of other state sponsored media.
