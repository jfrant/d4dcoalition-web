Researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute [compiled][link1] information to create an inventory on state-sponsored disinformation and computational propaganda practices around the world. The study found that at least 70 countries have used disinformation campaigns, specifically highlighting social media manipulation campaigns that took place on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. The [report][link2] found that while most government-linked disinformation was domestic, countries such as India, Iran, Russia, Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela attempted to influence views in foreign countries.
