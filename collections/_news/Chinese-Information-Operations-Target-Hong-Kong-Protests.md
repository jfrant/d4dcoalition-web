Twitter [disclosed][l1] its suspension of almost 1,000 active accounts accused of attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong and undermining the protest movement on the ground. The platform claims to have found evidence that the accounts were part of a coordinated state-backed operation from China. Twitter also [suspended][l2] an additional 200,000 inactive accounts that appeared connected to the campaign. A preliminary [analysis][l3] from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute indicates that the Chinese government may have been running the information operations for at least two years. A [report][l4] from the Institute for the Futureâ€™s Digital Intelligence Lab identified an additional 30 active social media accounts it deemed likely to be part of a coordinated [disinformation network.][l5]
