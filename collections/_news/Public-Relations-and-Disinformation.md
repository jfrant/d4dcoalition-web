The global industry of “black PR” firms, utilized by politicians, parties, and governments to manipulate online discourse and spread disinformation, is [flourishing][l1]. A new report by Buzzfeed reviews cases from Puerto Rico to Taiwan, where legitimate-seeming agencies offer black PR services such as fake social media accounts, websites, and coordinated harassment campaigns. In the Philippines, the industry has become so profitable that paid disinformation campaigns are no longer viewed as black market transactions but as respectable business tactics. The practice is so widespread that legitimate public relations agencies must offer these services in order to remain competitive with the firms willing to do so.
