China [is suspected][l1] of using social media manipulation to influence voters in Taiwan ahead of its recent election. The disinformation tactics include YouTube videos posted by China National Radio employees, phony government notices spread on social media sites, and paid messaging through Taiwanese influencers. In response to the uptick in computational propaganda, the government has strengthened laws against spreading false information and increased efforts to debunk hoaxes as quickly as possible. Social media platforms have also amped up efforts to evaluate content more stringently.
