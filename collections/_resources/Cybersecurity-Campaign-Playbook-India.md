Political campaigns need to protect themselves from hacking and often don’t know where to start. The good news is that there are a few fundamentals that can dramatically reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents. 

Produced by Harvard’s Belfer Center in partnership with D4D Coalition members NDI and IRI, the Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook was adapted for an Indian context to present high impact, easy to understand cybersecurity principles and practices that every campaign should put in place. It provides an easy to understand framework for managing cybersecurity risk, an overview of how to secure your campaign, how to plan for incidents, and a Top 5 checklist.
