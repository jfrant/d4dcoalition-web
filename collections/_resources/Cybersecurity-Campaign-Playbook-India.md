This Indian Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook was written by a multi-partisan and international team of experts in cybersecurity, politics, and law to provide simple, actionable ways of countering the growing cyber threat.

Cyber adversaries don’t discriminate. Campaigns at all levels – not just high-profile national campaigns – have been hacked. You should assume you are a target. While the recommendations in this playbook apply universally, it is primarily intended for parties and campaigns that don’t have the resources to hire professional cybersecurity staff. We offer basic building blocks of a cybersecurity risk mitigation strategy that people without technical training can implement (although we include some things which will require the help of an IT professional).

These are baseline recommendations, not a comprehensive reference to achieve the highest level of security possible. We encourage all parties and campaigns to enlist professional input from credentialed IT and cybersecurity professionals whenever possible.
