                <h3>Siasa Place Trains Women to Protect Themselves Online</h3>
              </header>
              <p><a href="https://siasaplace.com/">Siasa Place</a>, an NGO focusing on women and youth political participation in Kenya, in partnership with Deutsche Welle Akademie’s <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/womenweb-more-protection-for-women-on-the-internet/a-41845847">Women@Web project</a>, holds trainings to increase women’s participation and safety online. Through the research in the region, six out of 10 women have had personal experience with online harassment. Almost eight out of 10 say that they sometimes don’t have the courage to defend themselves, especially when they hear what happens to women who do. The project encourages female politicians to utilize social media platforms to share information and to campaign. There will another online safety workshop with female legislators in Nairobi in February. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=m6f66nYDx78&amp;feature=youtu.be">Here is a short video</a> describing the Women@Web project.</p>

                <h3>Elections Observation Group Says WhatsApp Must Do More to Stop Disinformation</h3>
              </header>
              <p>The Elections Observation Group is a collection of election monitoring groups in Kenya, working collaboratively to promote free and fair elections, part of which involves countering disinformation. In a recent article, ELOG wrote about the impact of WhatsApp on the spread of disinformation: “the messaging app has also come under fire for its role in spreading political propaganda and misinformation. In an effort to curb this, WhatsApp earlier had introduced a Forward icon on to every forwarded message to caution recipient and recently, it has set limits for forwarding messages. Also, with expanded features such as Forwarding Info and Frequently Forwarded, the platform hopes to help users in determining whether a message they received is widely circulated, and if it is, then chances are it might contain fake information. WhatsApp, policymakers and civil society groups should engage and focus on reforms that would enhance the platform’s capacity to promote participation and accountability while reducing the risk that it contributes to political manipulation and conflict.”</p>

                <h3>Brazilian D4D Partner FGV-DAPP Launching New Resource for Online Observation</h3>
              </header>
              <p>The Digital Democracy Room (DDR) is a Brazilian initiative by <a href="http://dapp.fgv.br/en/">FGV DAPP</a> – an applied research center based in Rio de Janeiro – which aims to analyze the impact of the internet and social media on the political-electoral process. The project’s goal is to monitor and analyze the transformations of the ecosystem of information in democracies and the use and dissemination of disinformation strategies. Initially focused on the 2018 elections in Brazil, the project enters a new phase marked by the establishment of key partnerships with institutions from other Latin American countries in order to expand its main goal of strengthening the democratic institutions in the region. These partners are Chequeado, in Argentina; Linterna Verde, in Colombia; and Ojo Público, in Peru. The project’s new <a href="http://observademocraciadigital.org/">website</a>, launching on January 20th, will contain analysis formulated by all partners in Portuguese, Spanish, and English.</p>
