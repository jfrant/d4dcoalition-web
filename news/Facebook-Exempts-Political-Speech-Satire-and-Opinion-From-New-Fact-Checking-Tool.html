These announcements drew opposition from U.S. Congress, particularly during CEO Mark Zuckerburg’s testimony on Capitol Hill. Zuckerberg also delivered a speech at Georgetown University, in which he defended Facebook’s opposition to fact-checking political ads and emphasized the importance of protecting free speech.
