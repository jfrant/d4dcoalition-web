Through the research in the region, six out of 10 women have had personal experience with online harassment. Almost eight out of 10 say that they sometimes don’t have the courage to defend themselves, especially when they hear what happens to women who do. The project encourages female politicians to utilize social media platforms to share information and to campaign. There will another online safety workshop with female legislators in Nairobi in February. Here is a short video describing the Women@Web project." />
