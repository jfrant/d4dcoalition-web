        <p><a href="https://siasaplace.com/">Siasa Place</a>, an NGO focusing on women and youth political participation in Kenya, in partnership with Deutsche Welle Akademie’s <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/womenweb-more-protection-for-women-on-the-internet/a-41845847">Women@Web project</a>, holds trainings to increase women’s participation and safety online. Through the research in the region, six out of 10 women have had personal experience with online harassment. Almost eight out of 10 say that they sometimes don’t have the courage to defend themselves, especially when they hear what happens to women who do. The project encourages female politicians to utilize social media platforms to share information and to campaign. There will another online safety workshop with female legislators in Nairobi in February. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=m6f66nYDx78&amp;feature=youtu.be">Here is a short video</a> describing the Women@Web project.</p>

              Elections Observation Group Says WhatsApp Must Do More to Stop Disinformation
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The Elections Observation Group is a collection of election monitoring groups in Kenya, working collaboratively to promote free and fair elections, part of which involves countering disinformation. In a recent article, ELOG wrote about the impact of WhatsApp on the spread of disinformation: “the messaging app has also come under fire for its role in spreading political propaganda and misinformation. In an effort to curb this, WhatsApp earlier had introduced a Forward icon on to every forwarded message to caution recipient and recently, it has set limits for forwarding messages. Also, with expanded features such as Forwarding Info and Frequently Forwarded, the platform hopes to help users in determining whether a message they received is widely circulated, and if it is, then chances are it might contain fake information. WhatsApp, policymakers and civil society groups should engage and focus on reforms that would enhance the platform’s capacity to promote participation and accountability while reducing the risk that it contributes to political manipulation and conflict.”</p>

        <p>The Digital Democracy Room (DDR) is a Brazilian initiative by <a href="http://dapp.fgv.br/en/">FGV DAPP</a> – an applied research center based in Rio de Janeiro – which aims to analyze the impact of the internet and social media on the political-electoral process. The project’s goal is to monitor and analyze the transformations of the ecosystem of information in democracies and the use and dissemination of disinformation strategies. Initially focused on the 2018 elections in Brazil, the project enters a new phase marked by the establishment of key partnerships with institutions from other Latin American countries in order to expand its main goal of strengthening the democratic institutions in the region. These partners are Chequeado, in Argentina; Linterna Verde, in Colombia; and Ojo Público, in Peru. The project’s new <a href="http://observademocraciadigital.org/">website</a>, launching on January 20th, will contain analysis formulated by all partners in Portuguese, Spanish, and English.</p>

              Facebook Pushes Forward with Controversial Ad Policy

        <p>Facebook <a href="https://apnews.com/90e5e81f501346f8779cb2f8b8880d9c">continued its call</a> for government regulation of social media advertising while doubling down on the platform’s refusal to limit or fact-check targeted political ads, even those containing misinformation. The platform’s policy is in stark contrast with those of Google and Twitter, which have taken measures to limit and ban political ads, respectively. Instead, Facebook announced that it will allow users to have slightly more control over the number of political ads they encounter and will improve user access to the company’s ad library. Politicians, activists, and even the company’s own employees have expressed criticism of Facebook’s policy for allowing paid “microtargeting” and questionable political advertising to undermine democracy.</p>

        <p>The National Endowment for Democracy <a href="https://www.ned.org/demand-for-deceit-how-way-we-think-drives-disinformation-samuel-woolley-katie-joseff/">released a working paper</a> that examines the psychology of news consumption and opinion formation in order to assess the demand for disinformation. The research aims to understand the factors that contribute to passive or active decisions to seek out disinformation in order to develop effective responses to the disinformation landscape. The report calls for improved communication between fact-checkers and difficult-to-persuade audiences, the enhancement of media literacy, and increased consideration of the impact of emerging technologies on disinformation.</p>

              The True Implications of “Fake News”

        <p>Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/fake-news-limited-effects-on-political-participation/">conducted research</a> on the implications of fake news on public participation in politics and perceptions of the media or political parties. The report collected data by examining consumption of fake news from untrustworthy websites and randomized exposure to misinformation. The study concluded that while both random exposure and intentional consumption of fake news increased the misperceptions of participants, the impacts on their political attitudes were inconsistent. The results question the validity of common claims regarding the effects of fake news.</p>

A new report by Buzzfeed reviews cases from Puerto Rico to Taiwan, where legitimate-seeming agencies offer black PR services such as fake social media accounts, websites, and coordinated harassment campaigns. In the Philippines, the industry has become so profitable that paid disinformation campaigns are no longer viewed as black market transactions but as respectable business tactics. The practice is so widespread that legitimate public relations agencies must offer these services in order to remain competitive with the firms willing to do so.</p>

        <p>China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/technology/taiwan-election-china-disinformation.html">is suspected</a> of using social media manipulation to influence voters in Taiwan ahead of its recent election. The disinformation tactics include YouTube videos posted by China National Radio employees, phony government notices spread on social media sites, and paid messaging through Taiwanese influencers. In response to the uptick in computational propaganda, the government has strengthened laws against spreading false information and increased efforts to debunk hoaxes as quickly as possible. Social media platforms have also amped up efforts to evaluate content more stringently.</p>

Although the company is no longer operating, the documents give new insight into its operations to manipulate the electoral system and influence voters on a massive scale. The leaks were found to have originated from former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser, who has expressed concern that the infamous Facebook data scandal was part of a larger global operation involving collaboration between governments, intelligence agencies, commercial companies and political campaigns to manipulate voters. Thousands of more documents detailing the company’s work in 68 countries are scheduled to be released over the next few months.</p>

        <p>Former Google executive Ross LaJeunesse claims that the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/02/top-google-exec-pushed-company-commit-human-rights-then-google-pushed-him-out-he-says/">ousted</a> him after he urged it to adopt a more formal program integrating human rights principles into its product development. LaJeunesse <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">started advocating</a> for a public commitment to respecting the rights to free expression and privacy after it seemed like Google might renege on an earlier decision not to cooperate with Chinese censorship demands. His suspicions were confirmed after reports about Project Dragonfly, the company’s plans to launch a censored search app in China, were leaked. After continuing to express concern over the company’s potential dealings with China and Saudi Arabia, LaJeunesse was informed that his position was eliminated, and he declined the offer of an alternative position with the company.</p>

              Study Shows Racial Bias in Facial Recognition Systems
            </h3>

        <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">released a report</a> assessing the accuracy of facial recognition software on different demographics. NIST evaluated 189 software algorithms and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/">concluded</a> that the performance of facial recognition algorithms were dependent on demographic factors such as age, sex and race. While some algorithms were more accurate than others, the study found that Asian and African American men were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men and that women were more likely to be misidentified than men. The confirmation of biases in the algorithms raises serious concerns about their use by law enforcement.</p>

              Leak from Private Firm Reveals Vast Location Dataset
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The latest piece in The New York Times “Privacy Project” features an enormous data file containing billions of cell phone pings harvested from millions of Americans all over the country. The file was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html">leaked</a> by an anonymous source in hopes of raising public awareness of the existence of the data and the risks of the data being abused. The data originated from a location data company, which is part of a larger location tracking industry that remains largely unregulated and unscrutinized. Although the practice is legal and companies claim the data they collect is anonymous, The Times was able to use the dataset to track and identify individuals across the country. This demonstrates that precise geolocation information is almost impossible to anonymize. When combined with other sources of identifying information and considering the risk of data breaches, the magnitude of location information available should raise serious privacy concerns.</p>

        <p>Last year, the Atlantic Council uncovered Secondary Infektion, a disinformation campaign that originated in Russia involving the spread of falsified documents through dozens of social media platforms. Social media analytics firm Graphika published <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-foreign/leak-of-papers-before-uk-election-raises-spectre-of-foreign-influence-experts-idUKKBN1Y6206">findings</a> from an investigation into the resemblance between a leak of UK trade documents and that of Secondary Infektion. <a href="https://graphika.com/uploads/Graphika%20Report%20-%20UK%20Trade%20Leaks%20&amp;%20Secondary%20Infektion.pdf">The report</a> found that the recent leak of classified government trade documents, which occurred right before the UK election, closely mirrored the Russian disinformation campaign in a number of ways. Notably, the UK leak gained much more traction in the media. It is unclear whether the leaked documents have been altered and how they were obtained.</p>

        <p>Apple shareholders <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50807372">will vote</a> on a motion that could force the company to disclose policies related to human rights and report decisions that could impact freedom of expression. The motion comes after a campaign group called SumofUs filed a resolution calling for the company to be more transparent. The group points to Apple’s removal of a mapping app during the Hong Kong protests as evidence that the company is pandering to Beijing. They argue that by complying with Chinese orders, the company could harm innocent groups of people and ethnic minorities.</p>

The investigation connected over 265 fraudulent websites and think tanks to Indian stakeholders through the Srivastava Group. Many of the sites used the names of extinct newspapers to repost syndicated content and publish additional stories sympathetic to India’s lobbying efforts and criticizing Pakistan’s role in the Kashmir conflict. The fake media outlets had ties to NGOs and think tanks that amplified their content through social media.</p>

The action would likely seek to block Facebook from enforcing policies that limit the ability of other products to compete. Facebook’s efforts to further integrate its own apps could also make it more difficult to split up the company in an antitrust case. The FTC’s decision to move forward with an antitrust action or seek an injunction over Facebook’s interoperability policies could come as early as next month.</p>

        <p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced</a> that the company will be funding an independent team to explore the development of a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191210/21054943552/twitter-makes-bet-protocols-over-platforms.shtml">decentralized protocol standard</a> for social media content moderation purposes. The team, called BlueSky, will experiment with a protocol approach that Twitter could potentially adopt. Platforms such as Twitter are struggling to adequately moderate propaganda and disinformation on their sites. According to a <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">report</a> cited in the announcement, the switch to a standard protocol approach could enable more free speech while limiting hate speech and large-scale disinformation efforts throughout social media.</p>

The social media platform is accused of contributing to a public health crisis by allowing claims of risks associated with the preventative drugs to intimidate patients at risk of contracting HIV. While the medications have been deemed safe by health officials and federal regulators, the ads were purchased by personal injury lawyers who point to data showing that the drugs can cause serious side effects when taken as a treatment for HIV. A spokesperson for Facebook claimed that the ads do not violate the company’s policies. As of now, the ads have not been assessed by any of Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers.</p>

Although the disclaimer was only visible to Facebook users in Singapore, the instance raises concerns about the law’s impact on freedom of expression in the country.</p>

However, many citizens have voiced opposition to being so closely monitored by the government. Concerns with the technology also include the risk of data breaches, hacking, and misuse of biometric data by private entities. China has already come under fire for using surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition to target and track Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.</p>

One former Twitter employee has been arrested and the other is believed to be in Saudi Arabia.</p>

Additional infringements on internet freedom included disinformation campaigns, internet shutdowns, and violence against journalists. 33 of the assessed countries, including the United States, demonstrated an overall decline in internet freedom from June 2018 to May 2019. Iceland was ranked as the best protector of internet freedom, while China was ranked as the worst abuser of internet freedom.</p>

              Twitter Bans Political Ads from Platform
            </h3>

        </header>
        <p>Twitter <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/twitter-political-ads">announced</a> that the social media platform would ban political advertising entirely, starting on November 22. The ban includes ads pertaining to specific candidates and issues, but spares ads encouraging people to vote. The move comes after Facebook was scrutinized for allowing political ads to contain false information. CEO Jack Dorsey explained the decision in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634360472829952">series of tweets</a>, writing, “This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.”</p>

Meme campaigns are often used to spread propaganda and disinformation to both boost and diminish support for political parties, candidates, and governments.

        <p>D4D Coalition member IRI published a report on the impact of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) influence on democratic resilience. The <a href="https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/chinese_malign_influence_report.pdf">report</a> consists of condensed versions of research findings from researchers in 12 vulnerable democracies around the world. It concludes that China’s aggressive influence campaign uses sophisticated methods to threaten democracy in developing nations. In order to combat malign influence, the report recommends that the United States and its democratic partners raise awareness of the CCP’s tactics and offer developing countries alternatives to Chinese investment and financing.</p>

        <p>During testimony to U.S. Congress in April 2018, Mark Zuckerburg outlined a plan to share a large amount of user data with researchers for the purpose of identifying and studying disinformation on Facebook. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/technology/facebook-disinformation.html">as the 2020 U.S. presidential elections near</a>, the company has yet to release any significant amount of data through the project. The platform claims that the delays are due to the challenge of protecting the privacy of users. Researchers have suggested that since 2016, disinformation campaigns have doubled and that Facebook remains the main platform for those campaigns.</p>

Messages can now only be forwarded to a maximum of 5 groups, down from 20, which had already been reduced from 256. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08740.pdf">Research</a> by scholars from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. shows that the app has been successful in slowing down messages containing disinformation from reaching a wider network with such sharing limits. This is significant, as WhatsApp was influential in the spread of disinformation leading up to elections in Brazil and India. The study suggests that the company should continue to take further action to limit viral chain messages.</p>

              Snapchat Releases Database of Political Ads, Highlighting App as Campaign Tool

        <p>Snapchat has joined peers Facebook and Twitter in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/15/tech/snapchat-political-ads/index.html?platform=hootsuite">releasing</a> a publicly available <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/?platform=hootsuite">library of political ads.</a> The ad archives feature includes information about who paid for each ad, the amount of money spent, and the targeted demographic(s). A spokesperson for the app stated that all political and issue-based Snapchat ads are reviewed prior to approval. The transparency of social media companies has been prioritized by U.S. lawmakers since Russian-linked ads and disinformation campaigns came to light during the 2016 elections. The platform remains popular with 2020 U.S. presidential candidates, who sell merchandise through ads and share photos and videos from the campaign trail. While the majority of the documented ads are from the U.S., the library also contains ads from Nigeria, Europe and Australia.</p>

        <p>Instagram <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/blogs-trending-49449005">launched</a> a new fact-checking tool in September, part of Facebook’s attempt to tackle disinformation on its various platforms. The new flagging feature on Instagram allows users to report a post with three options: “report,” “it’s inappropriate,” or “false information.” Posts that are rated as false by fact-checkers will not appear on a hashtag search and explore pages. The Instagram user whose content is reported and rated will not be notified.</p>

              Russia Switches Up Election Interference Strategy

        </header>
        <p>Prior to the September 8th Moscow City Council elections, a list that first appeared on a Russian site, VKontakte, was widely circulated on social media. Named after award-winning actor Vasily Lanovoy, <a href="https://meduza.io/amp/en/feature/2019/09/09/troll-factories-so-2016?__twitter_impression=true">Lanovoy’s list</a> appeared to name candidates who Lanovoy believed should be elected in every precinct, and was aligned with government-supported candidates. Despite the fact that Lanovoy refuted the list and denied that he had made it, it continued to be widely circulated online and in the media. The list appeared to have been circulated in response to the “Smart Vote” campaign led by prominent opposition leader Alexey Navalny and liberal activists, which pushed candidates in Moscow that were not favored by the current administration. Lanovoy’s list represents a new type of online disinformation campaign to influence elections and promote the Russian government’s interests.</p>

        </header>
        <p>As part of an online espionage campaign, Chinese hackers have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-uighurs-idUSKCN1VQ1A5">infiltrated</a> telecoms networks to track ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim minority group that the government considers to be a security threat. China has been facing international criticism for its mass detentions and state surveillance of Uighurs in Xinjiang Province. Many Uighurs flee Xinjiang and travel towards Europe to escape state persecution. According to a report by Reuters, telecoms operations in countries along the transit routes, such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand and Malaysia, have been compromised by groups likely aligned with the Chinese government. China has denied mistreatment of the Uighurs and any involvement in the cyberattacks, although the country has expressed concern that some travelers may be headed to join militant groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>

              The Real-World Impact of Information Gerrymandering
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1507-6">report</a> in Nature describes the phenomenon of <a href="https://twitter.com/jplotkin/status/1169307654293983234?s=15">“information gerrymandering,”</a> or how the structure of a social media network and the presence of zealots can bias a collective decision making towards one party, candidate, vote or issue. Similar to electoral gerrymandering, this outcome can occur even when both parties have equal sizes and each player has the same influence. The analysis uses a voter game model to examine restricted information flows and the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic distortion. The report also identifies examples of information gerrymandering in real-world networks, such as online discussions leading up to the U.S. elections, that could result in undemocratic decisions. It is noted that information gerrymandering can enable one party to sway outcomes in its favor, but can result in deadlock when there are multiple participants.</p>

The company is seeking a framework that will enhance existing privacy legislation, establish when user data can be transferred, determine how information should be protected, and designate who is responsible for the misuse of data. In addition to regulating privacy and election integrity, Facebook has an interest in securing a standard for data portability. Many Facebook users choose to transfer data between the platform and other apps or services, calling into question who should be responsible for protecting information once it has been moved.</p>

              Canada Combats Foreign Election Meddling

        <p>Canada spent three years <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/04/canada-foreign-election-meddling-1698209">developing</a> a detailed plan to combat foreign interference ahead of its election in October. After Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election became evident, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government passed a law mandating transparency surrounding political ads on social media platforms. Canada also created a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/protecting-democracy/critical-election-incident-public-protocol.html">Critical Election Incident Public Protocol</a> to notify political parties and the general public if credible threats of foreign interference are detected, however <a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2019/10/23/no-foreign-interference-detected-in-canadas-federal-election-officials-say/">the system was not used</a> during the election and no major foreign influence was detected, according to the Canadian government. Some were skeptical that the tactics can successfully prevent cyberattacks or the spread of disinformation, while others criticized Trudeau for focusing too specifically on Russian meddling, when his campaign was supported by Canadian progressive groups that received funding from the United States.</p>

        <p>A report from <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/exporting-digital-authoritarianism/">The Brookings Institution</a> highlights Russian and Chinese use of digital information technology to support authoritarian rule domestically and abroad. The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FP_20190827_digital_authoritarianism_polyakova_meserole.pdf">policy brief</a> compares high-tech Chinese censorship and surveillance to Russian intimidation tactics and its repressive legal system. The Chinese model is enticing for regimes interested in developing a surveillance network, while the Russian disinformation model serves as a lower-cost option for countries seeking to repress opposition and undermine democracy. The report concludes with a number of recommendations to prevent the export of technologies that advance digital authoritarianism, including the creation of a competitive democratic model of digital governance.</p>

Huawei technicians in Uganda and Zambia assisted officials with intercepting encrypted messages and hacking social media accounts, as well as tracking the locations of individuals. The company also provided training to police and other security forces on how to carry out domestic cyber-surveillance on political opposition. A spokesperson from Huawei denied that the company engaged in hacking activities or any other wrongdoing. However, evidence shows multiple examples of Huawei employees playing an important role in accessing the private communications of those accused of using “antigovernment rhetoric,” particularly in Uganda.</p>

              Chinese Censorship Rises Surrounding Hong Kong Protests as Facebook and Twitter Ban State Linked Accounts Spreading Disinformation
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Since protests began in Hong Kong this summer, China has used state media to manipulate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html">perceptions</a> of the situation domestically, in Hong Kong, and internationally. The country’s media and online censors have been manipulating the context of images and videos to undermine protesters, defend the Hong Kong police, and promote nationalism in a campaign which has included blatant disinformation as well as propaganda that often promotes anti-Western sentiments. Social media content that sympathized with the protesters or contextualized the protests was immediately taken down on domestic networks such as Weibo and WeChat. Both Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html">announced</a> their discovery and removal of extensive networks of Chinese-based accounts spreading disinformation, and Twitter banned all state-sponsored media from advertising on its networks.</p>

              Report on European Responses to Disinformation and Hybrid Threats
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The German Marshall Fund released a <a href="http://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/Jankowicz%20-%20Bandaid%20Effect%20paper.pdf">new report</a> that studies unilateral and multilateral efforts in Europe to counter Russian disinformation and hybrid threats. The paper uses six case studies to assess the extent to which new organizations are successful and avoid the “Band-Aid Effect.” Reliable funding is deemed essential, due to the disparity between spending levels of Russian interference operations and efforts to counter them. The report also highlights the importance of outreach to the press and public in order to raise awareness and increase resilience against the threat. Lastly, collaboration and the sharing of experiences between existing institutions is emphasized as a necessary aspect of creating long-term solutions.</p>

              YouTube’s Recommendation Engine Pushing Extremist Content in Brazil
            </h3>

        </header>
        <p>YouTube generates video recommendations based on user history and behavior through an algorithmic system designed to maximize watchtime, and the system suggests more provocative videos to keep users entertained. An investigation by the New York Times, backed by studies by U.S. and Brazilian universities, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">found</a> that the recommendation engine disproportionately diverts users to far-right and conspiracy channels. Members of Brazil’s supporters groups that back the current ultra-conservative administration credit the platform for their success and ability to reach a wider audience. The algorithm also has pushed users towards videos promoting conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination sites, among other politicized and often inflammatory content.</p>

              “Why Not” Releases In-Depth Analysis of Disinformation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Citizens’ Association “Why Not” utilized fact-checking platform <a href="https://raskrinkavanje.ba/">Raskrinkavanje.ba</a> to identify political disinformation targeting citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina between November 2017 and November 2018. Their in-depth <a href="https://www.power3point0.org/2019/08/08/exploring-bosnia-and-herzegovinas-disinformation-hub/">analysis</a>, which examines content published by over 450 digital media outlets, is the first of its kind to take place in the country. <a href="https://zastone.ba/app/uploads/2019/05/Disinformation_in_the_online_sphere_The_case_of_BiH_ENG.pdf">The report</a> analyzes the various types, sources, targets, beneficiaries, and redistributors of the disinformation. More than 60% of the articles containing information labeled as intentionally “false” or “misleading” dealt with political issues. The research found most sources of disinformation to be domestic, but identified a group of foreign outlets disproportionately using online tactics to push an agenda focused on undermining pro-democratic actors.</p>

              FBI Could Face Off with Facebook, Twitter Over Social Media Monitoring
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-and-facebook-potentially-at-odds-over-social-media-monitoring-11565277021?mod=hp_lead_pos1">requested</a> proposals for a tool to collect publicly available information from social media in order to identify and monitor online threats. The contracting solicitation asserts that it is possible to gather the data “while ensuring all privacy and civil liberties compliance requirements are met.” The social media monitoring service would likely violate the privacy policies of Facebook and Twitter, which explicitly ban the use of their data for surveillance purposes. The FBI and social media companies alike have been under increasing pressure to balance digital privacy with security in the face of mass violence and domestic terrorism.</p>

              Study Finds Facebook’s New Initiatives Failing to Counter Disinformation in the Philippines
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>Facebook <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/2020-philippines-disinformation">invested</a> in third party fact-checkers and increased the removal of fake pages and accounts in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign in the Philippines. Philippine President Duterte’s 2016 victory was attributed largely to waves of false stories, trolling, and other forms of digital manipulation across social media platforms such as Facebook. However, <a href="https://www.newmandala.org/disinformation">a new study</a> by researchers from the U.S. and Australia indicates that Facebook’s improved policies have done little to counter disinformation tactics. In fact, such tactics became more widespread in the Philippines leading up to the 2019 midterm elections. Opposition candidates who once rejected these strategies seemingly embraced an increasing amount of “professional trolling” and information operations within political campaigns, findings which highlight the risks for upcoming elections in the U.S. and elsewhere in 2020.</p>

        <p>With support from D4D Coalition member the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Center for Democracy and Development’s (CDD) Election Analysis Centre <a href="https://www.cddwestafrica.org/sorting-fact-fiction-cdd/">released</a> a report on the rigorous fact-checking process before, during, and after the 2019 presidential and gubernatorial elections in Nigeria. CDD’s mandate was to filter and check on viral stories that were false, with a focus on election logistics, election-related violence videos, and conspiracy theories. CDD and the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, also <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2019/07/whatsapp-both-strengthens-and-undermines-nigerian-democracy-says-uk-nigeria-research-team.aspx">presented</a> findings from research that examined the role of WhatsApp in the same election. The findings, which were drawn from citizen surveys and interviews with political campaigns, found that “while WhatsApp has transformed the electoral environment, it has not revolutionized it.” The report also offers short and long-term recommendations that augment more positive WhatsApp use.</p>

        <p>Ex-Facebook Security Chief Alex Stamos is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alex-stamos-internet-observatory/?mbid=social_twitter_onsiteshare&amp;verso=true">supporting the development</a> of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a shared central outlet for tech firms to monitor internet abuse, including political disinformation, as part of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. The Center would house the necessary machine learning tools, big data analysts, and access to user data, and is currently negotiating with major tech firms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube to access user data in real-time. They also plan to use data from sites with more extremist and abusive users such as 4chan, Voat, and Gab. Stamos believes that this centralized outlet could serve as a useful platform to monitor improper or abusive online activities.</p>

While the collaboration itself is to develop microprocessors that enable computers to analyze vast amounts of data more efficiently, Semptian receives a large portion of its business through iNext, a front company that sells internet surveillance and censorship tools to the Chinese government. The company has developed a technology called Aegis which allows the government to see location information of everyone in the country by processing huge amounts of personal data.</p>

The new labeling practice comes as social media companies seek to strike a balance between upholding the principle of free speech and their own policies against offensive and hateful content.</p>

        <p>During the 12 weeks before the 2018 Brazillian elections, Comprova, a collaborative journalism project, sought to verify or debunk questionable stories on social media and within messaging services. <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Comprova-Summary-Report-English.pdf?x74214">Their recently released report</a> analyzes the <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/what-100000-whatsapp-messages-reveal-about-misinformation-in-brazil/">types of misinformation</a> circulated in the run-up to the election, the reach of the project, and its efficacy in impacting beliefs. It concludes that collaborative projects have a significant impact on newsrooms and journalists, while also providing valuable datasets. The research also raises questions about the sustainability of such collaborations and the cost-benefit of these short-term projects focused purely on elections.</p>

              Study Shows Psychological Resistance to Online Misinformation Can Be Developed From Fake News Game
            </h3>

        </header>
        <p>Researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1507-6">designed a game</a> that enables players to deploy six commonly used techniques used for misinformation so that they may take on the role of a producer of misinformation. The 15,000 players were then surveyed within the game to determine any change in a participant’s ability to spot and resist misinformation. The findings show that individuals, regardless of education, age, political, ideology, and cognitive style, improved their ability to spot and resist misinformation after gameplay.</p>

              Myanmar Government Shuts Down Internet in Parts of Rakhine and Chin State
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>On June 20, all telecom firms were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/asia/myanmar-internet-shutdown-intl-hnk/index.html">ordered</a> to temporarily stop mobile internet service in nine townships of Rakhine and Chin State. Security operations conducted by Myanmar’s military in Rakhine state have forced more than 720,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. While government officials assert that the shutdown is for security purposes, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar believes it could have the reverse effect since the blockage may result in a communication blackout that impedes journalists and citizens’ ability to share what is happening in the region.</p>

        <p>A report released by the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur highlights <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Special-Rapporteur-report-Surveillance-and-human-rights.pdf">problems of targeted surveillance</a> used by governments to surveil individuals - often journalists, activists, opposition figures, and critics. It notes that such surveillance has grown amid weak regulatory controls, and has resulted in the arbitrary detention of individuals. Additionally, it proposes a legal and policy framework for regulation, accountability, and transparency within the private surveillance industry. It also calls for an immediate moratorium on the sale or transfer of tools used for private surveillance, tighter controls on surveillance exports, and restrictions on their use, in order to strengthen the protection of individuals’ rights to freedom of opinion and expression.</p>

        <p>New legal authority that allows for “clandestine military activity” in cyberspace, is being utilized to place potentially crippling malware inside Russia’s electric grid, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html">the New York Times reports.</a> This “aggressive” posture is in response to Russia inserting malware into parts of America’s energy infrastructure. Such repositioning runs the risk of escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow and reopens the debate as to whether a nation’s power grid is a legitimate target for cyberattacks.</p>

            </h3>

        </header>
        <p>D4D member NDI’s Gender, Women, and Democracy team undertook a <a href="https://www.ndi.org/tweets-that-chill">unique study</a> to explore the effect of gender-based violence, as expressed toward college-age, politically-active women on Twitter in three countries - Indonesia, Colombia, and Kenya. In these three countries, NDI worked with a number of women in politics, and civic technology and women’s rights organizations to examine the country-and context-specific challenges women face, as they engage in political discourse. The report finds that online violence against women in politics led to women pausing, decreasing, or completely stopping their Twitter activity. It also highlights the additional need for research to understand and mitigate the impact of violence against women in politics. NDI hopes these findings will be used to inform changes to social media platform policies and global legal and political frameworks.</p>

The report states that the EU strengthened its capabilities to detect, analyze, and expose disinformation; improved coordinated responses; implemented a self-regulatory code of practice on disinformation; improved societal resilience, and; has worked to protect the integrity of elections. It concludes that while there has been progress, more human and financial resources and a joint EU effort are needed to further protect our democratic processes and institutions.</p>

        <p>Alphabet subsidiary Jigsaw <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jigsaw-russia-disinformation-social-media-stalin-alphabet/?verso=true">revealed</a> that it purchased a targeted troll campaign for as little as $250 to contribute to its state-sponsored disinformation research. Jigsaw created a website with blog posts that focus on a contentious debate in modern Russia: how Stalin should be remembered - as a hero or a criminal. It then hired a fake follower and retweet seller to attack its own site with a social media campaign. While Jigsaw’s COO defended the experimental research, observers criticized it for <a href="https://twitter.com/StenderWorld/status/1138830086675656704?s=15">engaging</a> in disinformation operations and for not sharing the results.</p>

        <p>Research Symantec, a cybersecurity firm, concluded that Russia’s infamous troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, may not only have reached more users than previously thought, but may also have generated income for some of the phony accounts, some earning as much as $1 million. <a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/twitterbots-propaganda-disinformation">The analysis</a> also found that while most accounts were automated, many were manually manipulated in an effort to dodge detection. It also found that fake accounts targeted partisans on both ends of the political spectrum and most pretended to be regional news outlets. The Symantec report comes as they are evaluating the impact of interference attempts on the European Parliament election that took place at the end of May. Politico offers a contextual summary <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/05/study-russia-cybersecurity-twitter-1353543">here</a>.</p>

This paper reviews developments to counter disinformation over the past year and provides recommendations for next steps.While it recognizes the efforts by democracies to shift from “admiring the problem” to efforts to testing new ideas and solutions, and building resilience against disinformation, it also acknowledges that disinformation is also evolving and advancing. Recommendations in this report include policies and actions to limit the influx of disinformation and investing in long-term social resilience against disinformation, including digital literacy education and raising social awareness. It also recommends the establishment of a U.S/E.U Counter-Disinformation Coalition to bring together government and non-government stakeholders and a voluntary code of conduct outlining principles and agreed procedures for dealing with disinformation.</p>

              The Danger of Deepfakes Grows: Nancy Pelosi Targeted in Viral Video
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>“Deepfakes,” fake videos or photos doctored to look real, are a form of disinformation that have seen a troubling proliferation in recent months. Used to make it look like an individual (often a politician or entertainment celebrity) saying or doing something that they haven’t done in real life, they are becoming easier for anyone with the right technology to create. With new cutting-edge <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-ai-deepfake-can-fabricate-a-video-of-you-from-a-single-photo-mona-lisa-cheapfake-dumbfake/">facial recognition technology developed by Samsung</a>, for instance, an individual could make a depfake video using a single picture of their target. In May, thousands of Americans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/doctored-pelosi-video-highlights-the-threat-of-deepfake-tech/">were misled into believing</a> the authenticity of “shallowfakes” or simpler modified and slowed videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which she appeared to be drunk and slurring her speech. These videos, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1131728912835383300">one of which</a> was tweeted by President Donald Trump, are some of a growing number of altered videos that have been created by politically motivated individuals and groups to discredit their opponents.</p>

        <p>Government agencies, news outlets, and social media companies have noticed a huge spike of disinformation on social media platforms following April’s general elections in Indonesia. The government has <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-election-socialmedia/indonesia-curbs-social-media-blaming-hoaxes-for-inflaming-unrest-idUKKCN1SS1MM">temporarily halted</a> the uploading of certain images and videos on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp after posts making false claims and inciting violence increased exponentially in May. The spread of disinformative hate speech has likely contributed to riots that have killed at least six people as of late May, formed in response to the reelection of President Joko Widodo.</p>

        <p>Under political pressure from the Trump Administration, digital tech giant Google has decided to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-alphabet-exclusive-idUSKCN1SP0NB">end part of its business</a> with Chinese telecoms manufacturer Huawei. This means that future buyers of Huawei smartphones and other products will no longer be able to download Google made apps or services; Gmail, YouTube and the Chrome browser will be unavailable. However current owners of a Huawei device will still be able to receive updates on their Google software, and future users of Huawei hardware will still be able to access Google’s open-source features like the Android Open-Source Project. The announcement from Google comes after Huawei has received criticism from western governments for years for allegedly stealing the information and intellectual property of its users and providing it to China and other autocratic governments.</p>

              The Dawn of a New Strategy of Iranian Disinformation: Ephemeral Disinfo
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>A network of likely Iranian-linked social media bots and fake accounts has been discovered attempting to sow divisiveness and criticism of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. This new initiative, called “Endless Mayfly” by a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/">new report</a> from The Citizen Lab, is one of the largest attempts by Iran (or allied or proxy groups) to spread disinformation. Though similar in nature to attempts by Russian agents, this disinformation campaign was novel in that once fake accounts posted false stories and gained traction, they were quickly deleted. After these fake stories or reports had gained a significant amount of notoriety, the Endless Mayfly account operators then changed the link destination from a given false story to the legitimate website of the news organization or academic institution that the post was imitating. This strategy of “ephemeral” disinformation has the dual effect of obscuring the original source of a fake story, as well as giving the appearance that a fake story is linked to, or even created by, legitimate groups.</p>

WhatsApp said it was acting quickly as of May to close the app’s vulnerability to the malicious surveillance software. Many targeted individuals are human rights advocates.</p>

        <p>As the European Union prepared for its continent-wide parliamentary elections in May, Facebook’s elections “war-room” for the continent was hard at work defending the polls from misinformation on the social media platform, a practice that has been repeated in the U.S. midterm elections, Brazil and Ukraine in the past year.

        <p>The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) released a <a href="https://www.ned.org/foreign-authoritarian-influence-western-balkans/">new report</a> that focuses on the role of foreign governments in undermining the relatively recent democratic norms in the states of the Western Balkans of Europe. The report details the efforts of neighboring autocracies like Russia and Turkey, which have long histories of involvement in the region, as well as newer players like China and Persian Gulf States. These governments have allied with local elites who share their goal of undermining liberal democracy in the region. The motives for upending Balkan democracy range from Russia wanting to prevent further NATO membership, to China attempting to secure more lucrative economic deals without oversight from local regulatory bodies.</p>

        <p>A <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/study-journalists-need-help-covering-misinformation/">new study</a> conducted by the Institute for the Future has uncovered a disturbing truth about America’s journalists, namely that they are just as susceptible to falling for misinformation as any other group in the United States. More than 80% of more than 1000 journalists that were surveyed affirmed that they had been fooled by misinformation online. What’s more, only 15% reported having received any work-related training on how to spot online misinformation. The report further found that older Americans were more likely to be fooled than their younger counterparts.</p>

        <p>Responding to the threat of misinformation on its platform during electoral cycles in democracies across the world, social media giant Twitter has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/strengthening-our-approach-to-deliberate-attempts-to-mislead-vot.html">announced</a> the introduction of a new reporting mechanism in a company blog post. Through this new reporting mechanism, individual users can report false or misleading information about elections to company administrators, who will then respond accordingly, including removing the reported content. The introduction of this policy comes as Twitter prepares to receive an influx of millions of tweets about the Lok Sabha elections in India and the continent-wide European Parliamentary election.</p>

The system, called ECU-911, has been used by both domestic Chinese law enforcement authorities, as well as the intelligence agencies of countries like Ecuador, which purchases the system from China. The system is an interconnected set of thousands of cameras that has been billed as a way to prevent violent crime throughout a given country, but has been accused by rights activists as a way for national governments to spy on their citizens.</p>

Meanwhile, internet censorship is flourishing, and biometrics are being abused by governments across the world. The report centered around three central “spotlights”: the need for better machine decision making, ways to rethink the online ad economy, and the rise of smart cities.</p>

        </header>
        <p>On the heels of March’s Ukrainian presidential election, closely watched for signs of a concerted disinformation campaign by Russian linked entities, Finland held elections in April. As the country with the longest border with Russia of any EU member state, Finland also has an unfortunate history of being on the receiving end of attacks and coercion from its next-door neighbor. Things seem to be no different in the era of internet trolling from Twitter bots, and Finnish national security analysts have noted that Russian-linked social media accounts that spread false information <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-03-28/eu-s-bulwark-to-russia-mounts-defenses-against-election-meddling?__twitter_impression=true">remain a problem.</a> However, Finland has the benefit of a highly educated population, with above-average levels of internet literacy, making it somewhat more resistant to disinformation campaigns.</p>

To register, individuals must provide valid identification and enroll in a two-factor identification system, while also agreeing to let all of their political content posted to Facebook contain a label that reads “paid for by (organization name here).” It also announced an archive of any political ads, proposed safeguards against problematic ad content in the lead-up to its national elections in March and April.</p>

              In Wake of New Zealand Mosque Shootings, Tech Giants Suggest Greater Industry Cooperation on Content Removal
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The use of social media and video-streaming platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, etc. have become ways for individuals to spread images and footage of mass violence like that of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings in March. In response, the president of Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280914/microsoft-moderation-new-zealand-shooting-social-media">has suggested</a> creating a “joint virtual command center” to quickly respond to postings of such heinous acts. In a blog post, the industry leader has suggested that certain emergency situations like the New Zealand massacre be deemed “major events” that would warrant all companies providing social media or video-streaming services to work together on a temporary flag-and-remove campaign for offensive content regarding the event. Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/">followed this with an announcement</a> that it would be removing all content relating to white supremacy or separatism posted by users of its platform starting in April.</p>

        <p>NSO Group, a little-known Israeli tech developer, created “Pegasus,” an incredibly sophisticated software program that can allow users to spy on the mobile phones of others, even when those phones are encrypted. While the technology has been credited with saving lives by foiling terrorist attack and shutting down drug and human trafficking rings, it has also been used by autocratic governments to track down and eliminate dissident citizens like Saudi Arabia’s Jamal Khashoggi. Recently, NSO cofounder Shalev Hulio <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interview-with-ceo-of-nso-group-israeli-spyware-maker-on-fighting-terror-khashoggi-murder-and-saudi-arabia-60-minutes/">sat down for an interview</a> with 60 Minutes to defend his company’s controversial product.</p>

              Indians Are Primarily Getting Their English-Language News from Their Phones - So WhatsApp Added a Fact-Checking Service

        </header>
        <p><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/india-digital-news-report">A new Reuters research report</a> co-conducted with Oxford University shows that more Indians than ever (68% of those polled in the study) are receiving the bulk of their English-language online news from their mobile phones rather than computers or other devices. The report showed that social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp were the biggest mediums for accessing news for Indians, rather than directly going to the news source’s website. This has in turn prompted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/tech/whatsapp-india-tip-line-election/index.html">WhatsApp to roll out a new feature</a> for its users in India ahead of this spring’s national elections. The feature, a tip line called Checkpoint, will allows users to submit messages, pictures or videos that they want checked, and Checkpoint employees will verify their accuracy.</p>

Now in the fifth year of a civil war that has demolished much of the eastern part of the country, Ukraine has also been the victim of a calculated, intensive disinformation campaign by Russia, which backs separatist rebels fighting the Ukrainian government. The new “Learn to Discern” program aims to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren to spot stories, photos, videos and other media that are false narratives appropriated by Russian government sources.</p>

        <p>Ever more attention is being turned to the increasing prevalence and potency of private information intelligence companies in the wake of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">report published earlier this year,</a> detailing the work of a for-profit American firm on behalf of the Qatari government. A recent New York Times report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html">revealed</a> that as former state intelligence agents retire or defect from their agencies, private firms offer them employment on projects spying on behalf of corporations or smaller countries without the resources to operate a sophisticated spy network of their own. While these “internet mercenary” groups have been used to help stop Middle Eastern based terrorists, and violent drug traffickers in places like Mexico, they are also being used by autocratic regimes like Qatar to track rights-activists and journalists.</p>

While Putin’s United Russia party insists that the motivation for this is to increase Russian internet self-sufficiency, regime critics and internet rights activists argue that it is a move designed to eliminate Russian citizens’ access to international news and commentary that is critical of the regime. This action would not only be bold and technically complicated, but also a major setback to internet freedom in Russia.</p>

              The Strange Case of the “Deepfake” Conspiracy Surrounding Gabon’s President
            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>When Gabon’s longtime leader Ali Bongo addressed his nation via internet video at the beginning of 2019, observers noted that something seemed off. Multiple observers noted that the president seemed to have unnatural eye and jaw movements, and a radically different speaking pattern than in his earlier speeches. Gabonese opposition activists, politicians, and even some technology experts <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/deepfake-gabon-ali-bongo/">have acknowledged the possibility</a> that the video could have been a so-called “deepfake,” a deliberately doctored video or image of a person that shows them doing or saying something which never actually happened or was said. The claim is that the footage of Bongo - who has been in poor health, and out of the country since autumn of 2018 - was an edited video of someone other than the president, aired by his inner circle to dilute local fears of his death or resignation. While video and film experts who analyzed the clip have not said for sure that the Bongo address is a deepfake, they did not rule out that possibility.</p>

        <p>In a piece for the Foreign Policy Research Institute about his upcoming book, scholar Clint Watts <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/03/five-generations-of-online-manipulation-the-evolution-of-advanced-persistent-manipulators/">identifies</a> five “generations” of intentional online manipulation by state, criminal, and political actors, while making some dire predictions of internet’s future. The first generation, “Disrupting the System,” revolved around hackers committed denial-of access attacks shutting down people’s access to the internet. The second, “Exploiting the System,” was all about extremist groups (ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.) using the internet to gain followers, mainly through sites like Twitter, and Youtube. The third, “Distorting the System” was widely seen from Russian government sources deliberately spreading false and misleading information in western internet sources. The fourth, “Dominating the System” foresees a near-future when private companies, interest groups and political parties adopt Russian tactics to invent news on a mass scale to drive public narratives. The fifth, “Owning the System” will be in the medium-to-long-term future, when authoritarian regimes begin to disconnect their national networks from the world wide web, leaving their subjects to consume only government-approved online media.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When the government of Zimbabwe launched a large hike in fuel prices easier this year, large protests prompted the state to shutter all internet resources in a nation-wide web media blackout. In response, more Zimbabweans than ever <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/whatsapp-has-come-in-to-fill-the-void-in-zimbabwe-the-future-of-news-is-messaging/">began to turn to the communications application WhatsApp</a> to get their news, including reports of coordinated government use of violence against protestors. These “e-[news]papers” are sent by WhatsApp text message, complete with photos and often even soundbites, to the phones of thousands of Zimbabwean subscribers. Though e-papers delivered via WhatsApp have existed since at least the ousting of former national president Robert Mugabe in late-2017, they are becoming ever more common in a country where the traditional media space has slowly closed over the years.</p>

        <p>Facial recognition software grows in sophistication every year, but this isn’t accomplished without giving AI “practice”: Researchers often upload millions of pictures of human faces to the recognition software that they are developing so that their programs can further develop the algorithms needed to achieve greater face-sensing capacity. Often, the pictures the systems utilize are provided by corporations such as IBM, who take the photos from photography websites like Flickr. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921">When interviewed by NBC News,</a> some photographers were alarmed or disturbed that the photos they had taken of others might be used to electronically profile those individuals. These photographers complained that IBM had not sought their permission to use the photos, nor the permission of their artistic subjects.</p>

        <p>Seeking to improve his company’s beleaguered reputation, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">released a blog post</a> in early March in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253458/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy-encrypted-messaging-whatsapp-messenger-instagram">committed the company to the use of end-to-end encryption for its Messenger application.</a> This may or may not assuage the fears of many online privacy advocates, who voiced grave concerns earlier this year when Facebook announced that it would merge the operating systems of Messenger with those of WhatsApp, a secure messaging service it has acquired. Critics fear that end-to-end encryption could be removed or modified during the merger, giving governments, nefarious actors, and Facebook itself greater access to track the messages of users.</p>

        <p>International IDEA <a href="https://www.grts.gm/featured/international-idea-trains-staff-of-the-crc-in-public-participation-platform/">launched a pilot</a> Public Participation Platform (PPP) to support national
constitution-making bodies that collect, store and analyze data from public consultations. The PPP is an online system tailorable to country-specific processes and accessible to country-level staff through individual login credentials. It features a survey function with an accompanying public URL to facilitate public engagement on constitutional issues, a storage facility to upload publicly submitted documents and recordings, and an analysis component wherein data can be exported to CSV files for SPSS analysis. The pilot system was developed in partnership with the Gambian Constitutional Review Commission (CRC), which plans to use the online survey feature to reach local and diaspora Gambians.</p>

        <p>Leaked internal documents from Facebook show that the social media company has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment?CMP=share_btn_tw">engaged in a high-level lobbying campaign</a> with some of Europe’s most powerful politicians. The exposed memos describe a strategy through which company COO Sheryl Sandberg, a popularly known motivational speaker, used her influence and prestige to convince the political elite in European Union countries to repeal their extant information-privacy laws. Targeted politicians included former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.</p>

        <p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/ads-with-political-content-ukraine?__tn__=-UKH-R">announced a new policy</a> for its users in Ukraine, wherein they must register to promote political ad content on the social media platform. To register, individuals must provide valid identification and enroll in two-factor identification system, while also agreeing to let all of their political content posted to Facebook contain a label that reads “paid for by (organization name here).” This move is likely a way to safeguard against disinformation in the lead-up to national elections this year.</p>

            </h3>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>On December 7, 2018, the D4D Coalition Advisory Board issued a <a href="https://d4dcoalition.org/news/D4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">statement of solidarity</a> condemning the indictment of fellow Advisory Board member and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. In light of Maria Ressa’s arrest on February 13, 2019, on charges of cyber libel, the Coalition reaffirms the solidarity expressed in that statement, and reiterates its condemnation of efforts by Philippine government to silence Rappler. The charges stem from a seven-year-old story that predates the enactment of the 2012 Cybercrime Prevention Act. The arrest follows a <a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/84-documents/218088-document-arrest-warrant-maria-ressa-tax-caseD4D-Coalition-Advisory-Board-Stands-in-Solidarity-with-Fellow-Member-Maria-Ressa-and-Rappler.html">string of charges</a> leveled against Ressa by the Philippine government, which are part of a broader attempt to silence independent and critical voices in the country. For her work as a guardian in the war against truth, Ressa was named one of <a href="http://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/">Time Magazine’s 2018 Persons of the Year</a> and was the 2018 recipient of the Committee to Protect Journalism’s Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. Today the D4D Coalition echoes Ressa’s remarks upon accepting the award, “The time to fight for journalism . . . is now.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/facebook-elections/exclusive-facebook-brings-stricter-ads-rules-to-countries-with-big-2019-votes-idINKCN1PA0BW">Facebook announced the extension of content policies and tools</a> regarding upcoming elections in Nigeria, the European Union, India and Ukraine. The company is planning an ad hoc approach of restrictions on those who can advertise electoral ads before elections in Nigeria and Ukraine, as well as the creation of an online library of electoral ads in India.  Later in January, the social media platform <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools">blocked tools developed by ProPublica</a> and other media watchdogs, leading to criticism of Facebook from these groups, as well as lawmakers concerned with internet privacy. For over a year and a half, ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news agency, had been compiling information on hundreds of thousands of advertisements appearing on Facebook, detailing the identity of the ads’ sponsors, as well as who the ad might be targeting, with a software tool. In response to Facebook’s blockage, Mozilla Foundation then <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">penned an open letter</a> to Facebook condemning the action, which was signed by several e-media freedom groups. After garnering significant negative press from this open letter, facebook VP <a href="https://twitter.com/robleathern/status/1095020163127115776">Rob Leathrern announced via Twitter</a> that it would do more to disclose the sourcing of political ads for upcoming polls in the critical upcoming elections.</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <p>After Facebook <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools">blocked access to transparency tools</a> allowing users to see how they are targeted by advertisers, Mozilla Foundation and co-signatories, including D4D-affiliated groups, released an <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/">open letter to Facebook</a> calling for specific, time-bound action to improve political ad transparency on the social media platform ahead of the European parliamentary elections. In response, Facebook committed to opening its Ad Archive API in March, and reaffirmed its intention to roll out additional ad transparency tools globally by June. The D4D Coalition’s <a href="https://d4dcoalition.org/news/Mozillas-Open-Letter-to-Facebook-and-the-Responsibility-of-the-Tech-Community-to-Do-No-Democratic-Harm.html">post</a> regarding the events noted that the challenges relating to ad transparency are global in nature. Too often, tools and policies to address transparency concerns have been rolled out primarily in countries where tech companies have a large market, or face the largest political risk. The D4D post references the notion that tech companies have an obligation to “do no democratic harm” and that protecting the abuse of social media platforms in the context of elections should not be driven by market size or political risk to the company. Indeed, new or restored democracies may be the least resilient to disinformation and have the greatest need for protection. The post appreciated Facebook’s commitment to roll out a global response to the issue of political ad transparency by the end of June.</p>

        <p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">has accused an intelligence network</a> called Project Raven of working for and out-of the United Arab Emirates by spying on the perceived enemies of that state’s government, including American citizens. The cybersecurity company hired by Abu Dhabi to conduct the espionage, called CyberPoint, is an American group and employees many former National Security Agency employees. While in 2016 Project Raven shifted to the control of an Emirati cyber company, Dark Matter, a good number of the American employees remained with the team. Though interviewees stated that some of the main targets of Project Raven were violent extremist groups like the Islamic State, several other targets included journalists, human-rights campaigners and other dissidents of the UAE government; Project Raven began in 2009.</p>

        <p>Russia’s powerful media regulation agency, Roskomnadzor, has <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/russia-suing-facebook-twitter">initiated fines against social media giants Facebook and Twitter</a>. While the state-run agency claims that this action is in response to a violation by both companies of Russian communications laws, it is widely understood to be politically motivated. The Kremlin has a history of intimidating and punishing media and communications companies that do not comply with its laws that are designed to deprive users of online data privacy. Facebook and Twitter have refused to submit to Roskomnadzor demands to disclose the personal data of their Russian users.</p>

        <p>In response to a rise in violence fueled by disinformation on WhatsApp, the company made the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/22/whatsapp-is-trying-clamp-down-viral-misinformation-with-messaging-limit/?utm_term=.c20fd158a042">decision to limit the number of times a user can forward a message</a> to 20 around the world and five in India. India was home to the highest number of forwarded photos, messages and videos, resulting in over 24 murders by violent mobs which had been incited on the app. After an initial success with the new cap in India, WhatsApp decided to extend this limit to all of its global users. The company hopes that this change will refocus users on the app’s original purpose: communication with close contacts.</p>

Misinformation spread through social media has resulted in over 30 deaths in 2018, and officials are worried that an increase in fake news, encouraged by an election that is expected to be competitive, will result in further violence.</p>

The same group also studied <a href="http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2018/the-impact-of-greater-news-literacy/">the Impact of Greater News Literacy</a> in societies as well as the connection between news literacy and other behaviors connected to media consumption online.</p>

The study found that women from both sides of the political spectrum and both professions, journalists and politicians, were all targets for harassment. The project also found that 7.1% of the tweets monitored in the study registered as “problematic” or “abusive”. This percentage was higher for women of color, especially for black women, who were 84% more likely than their white peers to be talked about in abusive or problematic tweets.</p>

Platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have received less attention in the media, but were also found to have been used by groups such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, while the researchers also suggested that social media platforms would need to share more data to fully understand the full scope of the campaigns.

        <p>D4D network partner International IDEA has entered into a collaboration with the Electoral Tribunal of Panama in order to provide support to the newly created Digital Media Unit. The unit’s mandate is twofold. On one side, it is in charge of the online communication of the Tribunal in terms of Electoral information, providing a key line of information to the population through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp with the key electoral information. On the other, the Digital Media Unit is spearheading the fight against disinformation, with a 24/7 monitoring of social media war room, supporting the Tribunal to detect electoral offenses, campaigns to raise awareness around the dangers of spreading disinformation and engagement with diverse stakeholders to protect the electoral integrity. The Unit has also been in charge of launching the country’s first Digital Ethics Pact, encouraging the population to make responsible use of social media during the electoral campaign. International IDEA support will continue until the elections in May 2019 and beyond, aiming to position the Unit as the leader in the fight against disinformation in Panama.</p>

        <p>Following protests against the arrest of Afghan militia commander Alipoor, tensions were heightened by <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/30/how-fake-news-and-misinformation-are-stirring-ethnic-tensions-in-afghanistan/">disinformation spread through social media</a>. Government security forces posted that no civilians were harmed, while protesters circulated photos of a dead schoolgirl and others. National Directorate of Security Chief Massoum Stanekzai reported that commander Alipoor was arrested by the U.S. Military. However, a spokesperson for U.S. forces tweeted that they had no involvement. The government narrative was bolstered by photos of wounded security officers which were exposed to have been taken years prior.</p>

        <p>An independent BSR report, commissioned by Facebook, about the impact of the platform on the human rights crisis in Myanmar found evidence that <a href="https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf">Facebook did not take enough action to prevent violence from being spread on its site</a>. Thousands of people have died in the conflict, with hundreds of thousands more displaced internally and into neighboring Bangladesh. The report warns Facebook of future human rights abuses around the 2020 elections and calls for the company to both create a new human rights policy and enforce its current hate speech policies by working with the local authorities.</p>

        <p>The Harvard University Shorenstein Center for Media Studies published <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/the-fight-against-disinformation-in-the-u-s-a-landscape-analysis/">The Fight Against Disinformation in the U.S.: A Landscape Analysis</a>, which explores the key players, tactics, and support for learning and programmatic responses to viral digital culture. Societal changes impact the way that we use media, but these shifts are in all directions. When the way that people communicate changes, this is reflected in a shift in society as well. The paper discusses the impacts of the changes in media use on American culture and the ways in which some people are trying to combat the negative impact of computational propaganda, disinformation and other harmful forms of content.</p>

        <p>In new research from Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center, Henry Farrell and Bruce Schneier argue that nations <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273111">should approach disinformation as they approach other issues of state security</a>. Different vulnerabilities are presents and potential responses are required depending on the type of government structure; autocracy or democracy. While autocracies produce contested knowledge about political actors themselves, democracies produce contested information about who holds power. This causes democracies to be more susceptible to narratives about general political organization.</p>

In a country where many citizens rely on government programs to feed their families and receive medical care, opponents are calling the government’s requirement that citizens obtain the Fatherland card to access services akin to blackmail.</p>

        <p>With election day drawing nearer, disinformation efforts to influence voters increase. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/2018-digital-misinformation-roundup.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">The New York Times published a “Roundup”</a> of disinformation-related coverage, its impact on the U.S. midterm elections, and its spread internationally. In response to suspicious pro-Saudi Arabian government tweets, Twitter suspended suspected bots that tweeted and re-tweeted identical talking points including “#unfollow_enemies_of_the_nation.” Twitter also released 11 million tweets believed to be from state-backed information operations originating in Russia and Iran. Facebook pages that appeared to be for Women’s Marches were found to originate in Bangladesh and sought to sell march-related merchandise.</p>

In total, information about 3,841 accounts connected to the IRA in Russia and 770 other accounts have been released to the public. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/russian-twitter-bots-coachella-taco-bell">researchers found even more fake Twitter accounts</a> that appear to be linked to the Russian government that were not identified by Twitter’s search, promoting politically benign topics such as Taco Bell and Coachella.</p>

The paper further explains the relationship between politics, media, and ill-meaning actors. It lays out the tactics, technologies, and conditions that anti-democratic and politically-motivated actors use to weaponize digital advertising. The report finds that three main strategies are employed by actors who use the “Digital Influence Machine” to attempt to divide an opponent’s supporters, leverage behavioral science techniques to influence consumers, and mobilize those who support their views by threatening their identity, political or otherwise.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/brazil-election-fake-news-whatsapp.html">New York Times op-ed</a>, researchers and fact checkers in Brazil called on WhatsApp to make changes to its system when they found that it was being widely used to spread disinformation in the runup to the national election. A poll found that 44 percent of Brazilians use WhatsApp to read political news, and a growing amount of misinformation and disinformation has been shared widely through the app, and the writers called on the company to restrict forwards, broadcasts and limit the size of new groups in Brazil during the election period. A Facebook subsidiary, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/whatsapp-bans-100-000-accounts-before-brazilian-electio-1829886723">WhatsApp later banned over 100,000 accounts</a> associated with sharing false stories, but did not take up the suggestions before the election on October 28th.</p>

One of the largest forced human migration human history, over 700,000 people, is widely attributed to this type of anti-Rohingya propaganda and the violence it incited. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, reported that the company found “clear and deliberate attempts to covertly spread propaganda that were directly linked to the Myanmar military.”</p>

This data breach resulted from a flaw in an API that was created by the tech company to allow developers to access profile information about individuals who used their apps and had given permission to share their profile data. Internal memos, investigative journalism, and a <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/?mod=article_inline">blog post</a> shed light on Google’s decision to not go public with the information when it originally discovered the problem. Increased security measures including the termination of the Google+ service occurred in hopes of rectifying the problem.

The Summit provided an opportunity to share information about the Coalition with other groups sharing similar objectives, including the Global Tech Accountability Network, a new initiative arising out of the <a href="https://progressivevoicemyanmar.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Burmese-NGOs-to-Facebook-April-2018.pdf">#DearMark letter</a>, led by organizations in Myanmar.   Among the areas of collaboration discussed were the development of an open data standard on social media monitoring, together with a platform implementing the standard, for social media monitoring organizations to adapt to their own specific needs.  The use of shared tools and data standards provides an opportunity for social media monitoring groups to share data with like-minded, trusted partners in other countries, providing a more complete picture of hate speech or disinformation in a regional or global context.  In addition, the Summit provided an opportunity to connect with D4D partners, g0v and CoFacts, which is working with the Coalition to adapt the CoFacts fact-checking chatbot from LINE to FB Messenger and WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>The prevalence of deepfakes, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2018/09/14/the-cybersecurity-202-lawmakers-want-intelligence-chiefs-to-help-counter-threat-from-doctored-videos/5b9a97fd1b326b47ec9595b6/?utm_term=.14908678ca57">videos that are manipulated to show fake events</a>, is increasing, prompting Rep. Adam B. Schiff (R-FL) and Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) to call for an analysis of the problem and solutions by the intelligence community. In their letter to the Director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats, they call these videos a national security risk. Social media companies’ growing focus on stopping disinformation has been encouraged by pressure from Congress and the intelligence community and the lawmakers hope that the same trend will occur for the fight against deepfakes.</p>

Some of these fake sites are modeled after reputable news sources, complicating users’ search for truth. Researchers were surprised to learn that eight of the ten most-shared fake news sites were domestic, causing a renewed focus on local actors over international influences.</p>

        <p>The Chinese government has created a national-level platform, run by the ‘Internet Illegal Information Reporting Center’ and run by Xinhua to publicly differentiate fact from fake news for its citizens. To create the platform, over 40 “rumor-refuting platforms” were combined into the official platform. The purpose behind the creation of this new official fact-checker, state-run xinhuanet.com explains, was to <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/29/c_137428781.htm">stop rumors and illegal information from disturbing the social order</a>.</p>

        <p>A Reuters special report documents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">more than 1,000 posts, comments, and crude images</a> on Facebook calling for violence and discrimination against Myanmar’s Muslims. Despite official rules banning such hate speech, Facebook appeared largely unprepared to crack down on this wave of anti-Muslim posts. For a long time, the organization lacked enough Burmese speaking employees, as well as programs that can effectively detect hate speech in the language and systems to translate the text, among other limitations preventing an effective response. It has also recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-facebook/facebook-bans-myanmar-army-chief-others-in-unprecedented-move-idUSKCN1LC0R7">blocked the accounts of 18 users and 52 pages that are linked to Myanmar’s military</a>, further highlighting the country’s worsening relationship with the world’s largest social media network.</p>

The tech company will offer free cybersecurity protections to likely targets of groups like APT28, including campaign offices and candidates, provided that they use Office 365 software.</p>

        <p>Oxford Internet Institute’s Project on Computational Propaganda has a <a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2018/07/ct2018.pdf">new report analyzing the new and growing trends of organized media manipulation</a>, as well as the growing capacities, strategies, and resources that support the trends. In a fast-growing number of countries, political parties and government agencies are using social media to manipulate domestic public opinion, often in response to threatening foreign interference and junk news. Since 2010, political parties and governments have spent over half a billion dollars developing and implementing these operations.</p>

        <p>The European Union <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-be-fined-5-billion-by-eu-in-android-case-1531903470">issued Google a record-breaking antitrust fine</a> of €4.34 billion ($5.06 billion) over Google’s deals with mobile phone makers and telecommunications operators. According to EU regulators, Google’s contracts with phone makers effectively force those companies to prioritize Google apps and services in exchange for Google providing its Android operating system for free. The fine represents a major step towards stronger government oversight of technology companies, at least in the EU.</p>

        <p>The parliament of Uganda temporarily <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uganda-social-media-tax-stays-for-now/">maintained a controversial tax on social media use</a> despite widespread protests against it. President Museveni, who first introduced the law, has cited the spread of “gossip” as a key reason for its existence. Seen as an attempt at state censorship, the tax has led to a significant drop in social media use in addition to creating new economic burdens for the Ugandan people.</p>

Bot presence on Instagram continues to increase despite efforts by Facebook to curb the spread. The rise in Instagram bots is especially concerning since images and videos, uniquely difficult to track and identify, could play a larger role in coming elections.</p>

During the 2016 election, Arsov worked closely with several high-profile American partners to churn out over a hundred fake news websites on social media.

        <p>First Draft, a project of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, published a definitional toolbox of <a href="https://medium.com/1st-draft/information-disorder-part-1-the-essential-glossary-19953c544fe3">terms related to technology and misinformation</a>. The toolbox aims to create a shared vocabulary amongst policymakers, citizens, and academics. Part One includes a glossary defining “commonly used” and “frequently misunderstood” terms related to information disorder. Part Two attempts to map the thirteen sub-categories of the information disorder field in order to facilitate more strategic, targeted research and action. Part Three includes downloadable high-resolution graphics created to help explain information disorder.</p>

        <p>An investigation by the Digital Forensic Research Lab <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/electionwatch-loves-for-sale-in-brazil-f8033427dbe0">reveals a deep network of exchanges</a> between various users and several Brazil-based groups that sell pages, likes, and shares on Facebook for money. Like and share for cash transactions at large scale have the potential to threaten the integrity of Brazil’s upcoming elections, also a concern in Mexico’s recent elections that were also flooded with messages from inauthentic accounts.</p>

        <p>Research conducted by the German Tactical Technology Collective and their partners reveals that <a href="https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/whatsapp/">WhatsApp is now the primary platform for political messaging across the Global South</a>, especially in rural areas with limited internet access. The report analyzes this phenomenon, seeking to answer why WhatsApp is such a powerful tool, how politicians and campaigners use the platform, what strategies organizers use to exploit the platform and what the potential implications are of this trend. The report also includes several case studies of key countries impacted by WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>Vietnam recently <a href="https://www.cogitasia.com/vietnams-new-cyber-law-could-hobble-foreign-investors-and-limit-basic-freedoms/">approved a new controversial cybersecurity law</a> regulating technology firms’ use of personal data. The legislation requires that social media firms turn over subscriber information, IP addresses, and account information to the Ministry of Public Security and remove content from their platforms when requested by the government. The legislation also creates formulations for charging citizens for posting “anti-government propaganda” or any material that “incites violence and disturbs public security.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/wechatting-american-politics-misinformation-polarization-and-immigrant-chinese-media.php/">WeChat, a social media platform popular with Chinese Immigrants</a> in the United States, presents new challenges and a new perspective to the fight against misinformation. The platform heavily features local news and sensational stories, while passing over other popular topics including the economy and healthcare. WeChat shows many of the same characteristics as misinformation in mainstream media, but also displays ways in which immigrant populations diverge from norms because of its blend of U.S. media and Chinese media practices. On the platform, conservative voices feature loudly, with both liberal and conservative users discussing the role of Chinese immigrants in politics and in the United States.</p>
