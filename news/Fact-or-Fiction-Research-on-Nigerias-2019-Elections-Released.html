<meta name="description" content="With support from D4D Coalition member the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the Center for Democracy and Development’s (CDD) Election Analysis Centre released a report on the rigorous fact-checking process before, during, and after the 2019 presidential and gubernatorial elections in Nigeria. CDD’s mandate was to filter and check on viral stories that were false, with a focus on election logistics, election-related violence videos, and conspiracy theories. CDD and the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, also presented findings from research that examined the role of WhatsApp in the same election. The findings, which were drawn from citizen surveys and interviews with political campaigns, found that “while WhatsApp has transformed the electoral environment, it has not revolutionized it.” The report also offers short and long-term recommendations that augment more positive WhatsApp use." />
