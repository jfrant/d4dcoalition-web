<meta name="description" content="When Gabon’s longtime leader Ali Bongo addressed his nation via internet video at the beginning of 2019, observers noted that something seemed off. Multiple observers noted that the president seemed to have unnatural eye and jaw movements, and a radically different speaking pattern than in his earlier speeches. Gabonese opposition activists, politicians, and even some technology experts have acknowledged the possibility that the video could have been a so-called “deepfake,” a deliberately doctored video or image of a person that shows them doing or saying something which never actually happened or was said. The claim is that the footage of Bongo - who has been in poor health, and out of the country since autumn of 2018 - was an edited video of someone other than the president, aired by his inner circle to dilute local fears of his death or resignation. While video and film experts who analyzed the clip have not said for sure that the Bongo address is a deepfake, they did not rule out that possibility." />
