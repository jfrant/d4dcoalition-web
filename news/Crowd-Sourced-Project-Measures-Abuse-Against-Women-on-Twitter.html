<meta name="description" content="Amnesty International and Element AI’s crowd-sourced data project, Troll Patrol, monitored tweets sent to 778 journalists and politicians from the U.S. and U.K. during 2017. The study found that women from both sides of the political spectrum and both professions, journalists and politicians, were all targets for harassment. The project also found that 7.1% of the tweets monitored in the study registered as “problematic” or “abusive”. This percentage was higher for women of color, especially for black women, who were 84% more likely than their white peers to be talked about in abusive or problematic tweets." />
