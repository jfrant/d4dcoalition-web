<meta name="description" content="After Facebook blocked access to transparency tools allowing users to see how they are targeted by advertisers, Mozilla Foundation and co-signatories, including D4D-affiliated groups, released an open letter to Facebook calling for specific, time-bound action to improve political ad transparency on the social media platform ahead of the European parliamentary elections. In response, Facebook committed to opening its Ad Archive API in March, and reaffirmed its intention to roll out additional ad transparency tools globally by June. The D4D Coalition’s post regarding the events noted that the challenges relating to ad transparency are global in nature. Too often, tools and policies to address transparency concerns have been rolled out primarily in countries where tech companies have a large market, or face the largest political risk. The D4D post references the notion that tech companies have an obligation to “do no democratic harm” and that protecting the abuse of social media platforms in the context of elections should not be driven by market size or political risk to the company. Indeed, new or restored democracies may be the least resilient to disinformation and have the greatest need for protection. The post appreciated Facebook’s commitment to roll out a global response to the issue of political ad transparency by the end of June." />
